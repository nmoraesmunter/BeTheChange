#BeTheChange

Following [CRISP DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining) during the project.

###Business Understanding

With this project we want to answer the following questions:

* Can we predict victories and failures of change.org petitions?
* Can we help petitioners craft more successful petitions?
* Can we predict confirmed victories?

Given the time restrictions the project scope will be limited to:

- Petitions made to the US government.
- Train the model with closed petitions from 2010 to 2016.
