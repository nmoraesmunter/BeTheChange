#BeTheChange



Since 2007 [Change.org](https://www.change.org/) has been helping people to make their voice count. Some of them
have succeed collecting the needed number of signatures and some of those have been able to imply a real change.
The motivation for this capstone project is to find the actionable features of the change.org petitions and help users to
improve their petitions and help them succeed.

###Overview

* With this project we want to answer the following questions:

    * Can we predict victories and failures of change.org petitions?
    * Can we help petitioners craft more successful petitions?
    * Can we predict confirmed victories?

* How did you accomplish this goal? (Include an explanation that's not too technical)
* What are your results?
* How can I see what you did? (Link to your live app!)

###An in-depth explanation of your process

* What algorithms and techniques did you use?
* How did you validate your results?
* What interesting insights did you gain?

###Code walk-through

* Give an overview of what each section of your code does.
* Make it clear to the reader of your repo how they should navigate your code.
* If you have a particular bit of code you think is clever or where the meat of your work is, make sure to point it out. If you tell them what to look at, they will listen.

###How to run on my own

* Give instructions for how to run your code on their computer (e.g. Run `python scraper.py` to collect the data, then run...)
