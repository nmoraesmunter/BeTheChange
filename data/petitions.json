What was supposed to be a sweeping, landmark piece of legislation to protect the environment and health of the public has been watered down so much, it now looks like protection for consumer product manufacturers.\n \nThe regulations should not bypass all but three segments of consumer products. Nor should they allow small amounts of lead and bisphenol A to hit the market sight unseen, or open the door for manufactures to hire each other as product reviewers because they don\u2019t have to be state certified.\n\nThis is a serious enough issue to demand real regulations\u2014not the weak, special interest-supported initiative the people have been presented with. \n\nPlease skip the January 1st deadline, withdraw the regulation and allow the next administration to overhaul and strengthen these rules. This has the potential to be a landmark regulation that other state may want to mimic. Please make sure that it's worth this honor.",

Most Cambodian-American Refugee detainees have already served time for past crimes. However under current immigration law they are considered \"Criminal Aliens,\" and many are \"deportable\".\u00a0This is abitrary and unjust. \u00a0This past summer\u00a0Around 200 Cambodian-American Refugees across the nation have been detained by I.C.E. during Home and Road raids and searches.\u00a0Double punishment is wrong!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most Cambodian-American Deportees were raised in America after\u00a0legally\u00a0migrating with their families at a very young age.

The Cambodian Consulate has written a letter to I.C.E., stating that they intend to drop his case and refuse to issue him travel documents for deportation.  Sophane has sent 4 letters to I.C.E. requesting a case review, and they still have not given him a clear answer as to why he is being detained. Holding him indefinitely in detention after already paying his debt to society is unnecessary. The double punishment he is being forced to endure is unjust.\n\n          Sophane legally migrated to America as a Refugee with his family in 1986 after surviving war and genocide in Cambodia.  Sophane was only 3 years old, and America is the only country he knows.  He has no memories of Cambodia and is unfamiliar with Cambodian language and culture.  He has no remaining family members in Cambodia, and deporting him or indefinitely detaining him in Immigrant Detention would surely drive his family into poverty.\n\n          Sophane has been a main source of support for his Mother, younger Sister, and two Nephews who are 2 and 6 years old.  He is the only father figure that they have had since they were born.  Sophane's mother, who is recovering from traumatic experiences during genocide and war in Cambodia,  suffers from severe depression.  Her condition requires round-the-clock care that Sophane used to provide with his sister her prior to his arrest.  He also used to provide car maintenance duties while employed at EZ Lube.  He gained a good reputation for what he does and would often fix his family and friends' cars at home. His family has waited patiently for his release, and they are suffering tremendously without him. \n\nSophane's indefinite detention is inhumane and the community is asking for his release.\n\nPlease release him from custody and allow him to return home with his family where he belongs.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Undersigned",

Free speech has always had limitations to protect society: It is my opinion that funeral rites is an exercise of Freedom of Religion: In that, Westboro church has desecrated Holy Services, which also cost the family money (funeral services are far from cheap) and defies the surviving family's right of religious expression; desecration of Holy Funeral Services also causes assault* upon all members of survivors.</p>\n<p>I also feel it is Shameful of the American Civil Liberties Union for supporting these abominations as \"free speech\" -\u00a0 at the expense of sacrificing freedom of religion (funeral rites is a religious ceremony), and monetary damages due to desecration of Holy Services that cost the family monies which the ceremony itself became personal property since it was bought and PAID for.

One CANNOT yell \"bomb\" at an airport. One CANNOT threatened the President. One CANNOT publish simply anything because there are libel and slander laws.  Copyright laws. Etc. Free speech has always had limitations to protect society: It is my opinion that funeral rites is an exercise of Freedom of Religion: In that, Westboro church has desecrated Holy Services, which also cost the family money (funeral services are far from cheap) and defies the surviving family's right of religious expression; desecration of Holy Funeral Services also causes assault* upon all members of survivors.\n\nI also feel it is Shameful of the American Civil Liberties Union for supporting these abominations as \"free speech\" -  at the expense of sacrificing freedom of religion (funeral rites is a religious ceremony), and monetary damages due to desecration of Holy Services that cost the family monies which the ceremony itself became personal property since it was bought and PAID for.  (I feel Freedom of speech is not a defense in these cases.)\n \n<a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-eastern-missouri-applauds-decision-free-speech-case\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-eastern-missouri-applauds-decision-free-speech-case</a>\n\nEmotions are intense during funerals, and at high risk of erupting into violence during these \"protests\". Actually the Westboro church does not fall into the interpretation of \"peaceful assembly\" because a funeral is supposed to be solemn-they are hollering with fists very insulting, abusive, and obscene insults (using derogatory terms \"faggots\", \"fags\") which can easily incite violence and riots due to the emotions running high during a funeral service (ritual), endangering public safety should that happen. \n\nI propose these abominations of protest activities during holy Funeral services, are not freedom of speech, but violations of Right of Religious Expression, and  causes monetary loss due to desecration of religious funeral rites which is a purchased product in itself. This is no different than defacing private property since the funeral services were paid for: Therefore is not protected under Free Speech.\n\nThank you.\n\n*(Definition of assault: \"The act required for an assault must be overt.

    "overview": "<p>URGENT ALERT: Mother's fast for son trapped in Western State Hospital!</p><p>Support Siddharta\u2019s mother, Cindi Fisher who is fasting to win the human rights of her son who is trapped in Western State Hospital.  Siddharta\u2019s mother has been fasting for 42 days, three-days-a-week fast to protest his treatment. Siddharta Fisher is 33 years old and was involuntarily committed to Western State Hospital (WSH) for 30 days.\u00a0 On Friday, December 3, his 27th day, Dr. Oleger petitioned the court to continue to detain Siddharta against his will and his mother's consent. This could mean force drugging Siddharta for up to an additional 180 days. Siddharta\u2019s hearing is this Thursday December 16, 2010. He wants to come home. He does not want to stay in the hospital. \nSiddharta has been involuntarily sent to Western Sate Hospital over eight times in the last few years from two weeks to nine months.\nHaving little or no \"VOICE OR CHOICE\" in the treatment or recovery plan has meant that he is often violently forced into five-point restraints and then massively drugged against his will or at the very least coerced.\nThe short term effect of the drugging sometimes achieves a temporary masquerading of symptoms to satisfy the court, or the treatment team. But the long term effect of robbing him of his dignity through violently administering medication against his will, denying him a real voice or choice in the treatment plan, and administering the highly potent mind-altering, addictive drugs is a serious loss and deterioration of his quality of life and an increase in bizarre, unusual and sometimes aggressive behaviors (a known long term side effect as well as withdraw effect of the medication). <br></p><p>\nThis is known as Short Term Efficacy Long Term Chronicity and is verified in over 50 years of suppressed research which has been summarized and exposed in Anatomy of an Epidemic, a book written by the award winning author Robert Whitaker. <br></p><p>Examples of Loss of Quality of Life for Siddharta include: <br></p><p>\u2022\tA very sad and disturbing deterioration of his passion for life. <br></p><p>\u2022\tHe no longer plays the keyboard or writes poetry... these activities were like his heart and soul.\u00a0 A deterioration in his physical health and well being. <br></p><p>\u2022\tPhysically, since being medicated over many years, he has developed a massive goiter. <br></p><p>\u2022\tHe now diagnosed with diabetes. <br></p><p>\u2022\tHe often experiences akathisia, a direct effect of psychiatric drugs, which is a inner torment that forces one to pace to seek relief that is nonexistent. <br></p><p>Support Siddharta\u2019s human rights and write now so that he can come home and recover in a way that empowers him. Although the mental health teams, both local and state, do not offer support in alternative empowerment and recovery models, almost all of the non-mainstream research indicate that relationship building is the core of healing and empowerment. \nSee Siddharta\u2019s mothers website and read about Cindi Fisher\u2019s 42 day fast, The Village Vision, and also Western States last very poor discharge plan at <a href=\"http://www.MentalHealthRightsYES.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.MentalHealthRightsYES.org</a>. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Please contact Washington State Governor Gregoire TODAY or as soon as possible (her contact info and the request statement is below) and tell her to tell the head of Western State Hospital, Jess Jamison, to DENY the petition to keep Siddharta another 180 days!\nACTION\n \nPLEASE contact State of Washington Governor Chris Gregoire.\n\nPhone: 360-902-4111 FAX: 360-753-4110\u00a0 Click here: <a href=\"http://www.governor.wa.gov/contact/%20\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.governor.wa.gov/contact/\u00a0\u00a0</a></p><p>Ask Gov.

Government representatives have issued serious and unjustified threats against Mr. Assange and his non-profit media organization which serve only to maintain a cloak of secrecy around high crimes and violations of international law, including torture, tampering with democratically elected governments, illegal bombings and wars, surveillance, mass slaughter of innocent civilians and more.\n\nWe call on all governments, organizations, and individuals of conscience forcefully to condemn and reject all U.S. efforts to fraudulently criminalize the legitimate journalism of Julian Assange, WikiLeaks and related efforts to expose an increasingly lawless U.S. government to the indispensable democratic requirement of public scrutiny. True or false, any charges which the Swedish government may pursue are irrelevant to the primacy of an independent free press. \n\nJournalists should not be made into criminals for publishing materials critical of the government.  Therefore, we reject any efforts to extradite Julian Assange to the United States or allied client states in relation to these matters. We condemn and reject every incitement to murder, incarcerate or in any way harm Mr. Assange. We encourage all those with information on corruption and violations of law to take courage from the example of Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks by acting to expose all such information into the light of public and judicial review.",

This practice is contaminating Iowa's rives and streams. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources estimates that there are more than 540 rivers with poor water quality partly due to this issue. Recently a farm spraying liquid manure on a frozen field contaminated a nearby stream and killed more than 2,000 fish. There have been over 700 manure spills since 1995. \n\nIt is time to stop this practice. Farms must find responsible ways of disposing of the waste they produce. It is unconscionable to allow a few to destroy Iowa's rivers. Now that you have been elected, you must pass an executive order closing this loophole and ending this practice. \n\nOn behalf of Iowa - please ACT now!\n\n\nWith hope and determination,",

Refund all people that have donated to your homophobic organization.\n3. Offer a public apology to the LGBT community and speak out against suicides caused by homophobia.\n \nHomophobia creates bullies which in turn, harass and demean gay people which can and has pushed people into suicides.  Making someone feel ashamed of who they are through ex-gay camps or similar programs gives gay bashers a license to bash.\n \nThis practice must END!\n \nI have sent this to countless organizations and legal firms for their investigation and review.",

Just before he was set to get his high school diploma and enroll in college, he was detained after getting into a minor car accident and fleeing for a few minutes in a panic over his immigration status.\n\nSelvin has been an exemplary member of his community. He is hard working, a committed student, and a faithful member of his church. In no way does he deserve detention and deportation from the United States.\n\nSelvin and other immigrant youth like him who hold so much promise, can also be helped by the federal DREAM Act (S.729), which is currently sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Lugar and Durbin recently sent a letter to DHS urging the agency to refrain from deporting DREAM Act eligible students.\n\nIf Congress fails to act on the DREAM Act this year, another entire class of outstanding, law-abiding high school students will graduate without being able to plan for the future, and like some will be removed from their homes to countries they barely know. This tragedy will cause America to lose a vital asset: an educated class of promising immigrant students who have demonstrated a commitment to hard work and a strong desire to be contributing members of our society.\n\nI join others in urging you to intervene in Selvin\u2019s case immediately and halt his deportation. I also hope and humbly request Senator Collins and Senator Snowe, both of whom voted in favor of cloture on the DREAM Act in 2007, to go a step further and cosponsor the bill.",

This terrible oversight that has led to thousands of heartbreaking cases of gratuitous cruelty in forcing same-sex binational couples apart could be fixed with the passage of UAFA. UAFA would add three simple words to existing U.S. immigration law \u201cor permanent partners\u201d wherever the word \u201cspouse\u201d appears. It would then give the same rights and responsibilities to same-sex binational couples that opposite-sex binational couples can currently obtain. \n\nWe urge you, our supporters, to do what you can in the lame duck session of Congress to either move UAFA forward as a standalone bill, or ensure that it remains included in any version of Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR). Our families are grateful to you for your support to date, and are depending on your support now and in the future. \n\nWhether you are returning to Congress in its 112th session next year or leaving at the close of this \nsession, we hope that you will continue to support equal rights for LGBT Americans and continue to \nchampion the end of immigration discrimination against same-sex binational couples. \n\nSincerely, \n\nThe members and supporters of Out4Immigration",

    "overview": "<p>Last year, Governor Schwarzenegger slashed funding for the Williamson Act out of the California state budget, putting thousands of acres of the nation's best farmland at risk of development.</p>\n<p>The Williamson Act is a nearly 50-year program that lowers the property taxes that landowners pay if they agree to sign a contract promising not to develop the land for 10 or 20 years. The land is protected from being paved over and farmers are better able to afford the land they grow on. The state makes up the difference by paying counties for the lost tax revenues.</p>\n<p>When the reimbursements disappeared, counties absorbed the loss, but they don't seem willing to continue to do so. Imperial County has already opted out of participating in the program completely, and others have put moratoriums on new contracts. Senate Bill 863 passed in October and served as a stop-gap measure, allowing counties to shorten contracts from 10 years to 9 or from 20 years to 18 in exchange for a 10 percent gain in property tax revenue, and this year California has restored a quarter of the needed funding, but this is a band-aid, not a solution. It will still lead to more land being lost that otherwise might have been preserved.</p>\n<p>Even before this budget cut, California was loosing farmland at an alarming rate. The <a href=\"http://www.farmland.org/programs/states/ca/Feature%20Stories/PavingParadise.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Farmland Trust</a> estimated in 2007 that another 2 million acres could be lost by 2050. That number will surely become much worse if we don't fully restore Williamson Act funding. California grown nearly half of the country's fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Sign the petition now and ask the California government to ensure the food security of the entire nation by protecting California farmland now!</p>\n<p><em>Photo: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/markus941/2237869730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Markus</a></em></p>",

The biggest reason for owl decline is loss of suitable habitat from past logging.\n\n-Protect all owl sites, occupied or not. Owls will repopulate unoccupied owl sites if there is enough suitable habitat.\n\n-Preserve the Late Successional and Riparian Reserve networks of the Northwest Forest Plan as a cornerstone of the restoration and recovery of spotted owls. The reserves should be a building block for owls while we also protect all suitable habitat in the Matrix and on non-federal lands.\n\n-Include the recommendations of scientific peer reviews conducted as part of this recovery plan.\n\n-Develop better science before assuming that aggressive thinning will help owls in drier forests on the eastern edge of the Cascades and in southern Oregon and Northern California. Aggressive thinning in drier forests can cause long-lasting, irreparable harm to existing spotted owl habitat.\n\nThank you for considering these requests.\n\nWarmest Regards,",

This chemical causes cancer, poses extremely high risks to farmworkers and pregnant women, and has the potential to contaminate our scarce groundwater resources with high levels of iodide. \n\nMethyl iodide soil fumigation products were registered by the US EPA in 2007 despite serious concerns raised by 55 scientists who are members of the National Academy of Sciences, five of them Nobel Laureates. In a letter to U.S. EPA, these scientists stated, \u201cIt is astonishing then that the Office of Pesticide Programs is working to legalize broadcast releases of one of the more toxic chemicals used in manufacturing into the environment.\u201d \n\nThis winter, the California Scientific Review Panel completed its review of California Department of Pesticide Regulation\u2019s methyl iodide risk assessment, concluding: \n\n\u201cBased on the data available, we know that methyl iodide is a highly toxic chemical and we expect that any anticipated scenario for the agricultural or structural fumigation use of this agent would result in exposures to a large number of the public and thus would have a significant adverse impact on the public health. Due to the potent toxicity of methyl iodide, its transport in and ultimate fate in the environment, adequate control of human exposure would be difficult, if not impossible. This is clearly shown in the DPR risk calculations and the evidence of the toxicity of methyl iodide upon which these conclusions are based is compelling. In addition to the evidence for significant toxicity there is a lack of information that adds further uncertainty to the evaluation of the toxicity. We have concluded there is little doubt that the compound possesses significant toxicity. \n\nFurthermore, this is coupled with a major lack of critical health effects data that could make the upside to all of the risk calculations even higher, as noted above. Specifically, several areas in the exposure assessment could lead to estimated margins of exposure even smaller than those presented in the report; examples include: inhalation rates, environmental temperature, emission rates, skin exposure, the assumption of the adequacy of the respirator protection factors, the hours in a workday, and potential water contamination\u201d \n\nThis is an issue of farmworker health, children\u2019s health and of environmental justice. The science is strong. It is time for a re-evaluation. We urge you to immediately put a stop to the registration of methyl iodide as a soil fumigant.",

City Council meeting, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/07/AR2010120707009.html?hpid=newswell\" rel=\"nofollow\">a plan</a> was approved that would cut off direct public assistance to recipients who are on the program longer than five years.\u00a0The plan will cut and over time eliminate benefits to city residents who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (<a href=\"http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">TANF</a>) benefits for over five years. This is even more difficult to comprehend as it is coming from Gray who has worked with families in need as the former Director of D.C.\u2019s Department of Human Services.</p>\n<p>As a nation, aren\u2019t we working to end the dangerous cycle of poverty? But by cutting TANF, Gray would be fueling this cycle and providing little means for families to becoming more self-sufficient. People must have their basic needs met in order to remain stable and build towards further prosperity. Cutting benefits becomes counterproductive to the overall goal of helping people overcome poverty. America is the wealthiest nation in the world. We are better than this. All of our citizens deserve the opportunity to build a more fulfilling life.</p>\n<p>Working together, we can create a collective, powerful voice to influence real change. Let\u2019s welcome Vincent Gray to his new position as Mayor of Washington, D.C. with a petition letter! \u00a0Demand that he overturn the decision to cut this vital funding!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

Council decision to cut off direct public assistance to recipients who are on the TANF program longer than five years. As Human Services Director, you have worked with some of D.C.'s most vulnerable families. You must be aware of the impact of TANF benefits for these families. They are already struggling with next to no support and financial means. To further cut services could be devastating to these families and also to your entire city. \n\nAs the new Mayor, we kindly ask that you reinstate TANF benefits and not make any cuts to services. Every family deserves the opportunity to have a stable life and build towards prosperity. Without TANF benefits, the cycle of poverty will continue for generations to come. You can take active steps to stop the cycle of poverty now.\n\nThank you for your time.",

You promised that \"This year we are going to bring down DADT.\u201d You have failed to fulfill your promise and should therefore resign your position as President of the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nRecently in your letter to contributors you essentially conceded that we had lost this battle in Congress and shifted the pressure to President Obama. You insisted President Obama issue a stop-loss order halting military discharges and cease defending DADT in federal court. In comparison to an act of Congress, these are relatively simple things for the President to accomplish. Ceasing to defend DADT in court would accomplish the same long-term solution as an act of Congress. This is clearly one of the largest strategic blunders in the history of the homosexual rights movement and you should take responsibility immediately. Despite his excuses to try otherwise, pressuring the President to cease defending DADT in court should not have been plan B. A stop-loss order should be issued and remain in effect until DADT is no longer in place via the courts or Congress. \n\nAs you know, another separate bill to repeal DADT was introduced today. Yet just last evening you conceded defeat and switched strategies. This leads me to believe that you and the HRC have no insight into what is really occurring in Washington and are simply observing this process just as we the contributors are also doing.\n\nWhat our community and the HRC\u2019s contributors now need is leadership that can effect policy change in Washington. Until you resign, and new leadership has established that capability for the HRC, I will no longer be contributing to this organization. I\u2019m encouraging my friends, family and readers to copy this email to you and take the same position.\n\nSincerely, \n\nEthan August",

    "letter_body": "Recently, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) ruled that a program on your network, WordTV with Charles McVety, violated a number of legal and ethical standards. Specifically, the CBSC documented how the program fosters a culture of violence, discrimination and stigmatization toward people on the basis of their sexual orientation, national origin, religion, and gender identity.\n\nSpecifically, they noted that McVety has used his program on your network to call gay people \"pedophiles,\" and to suggest that pride parades were \"a pedophile's dream.\" He has also suggested on your airwaves that gay people prey on children, and convert them to homosexuality. These are totally unsubstantiated opinions, and they foster a climate where violence and discrimination toward people on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity can thrive. It is not responsible for your network to allow such programming on its airwaves.\n\nMoreover, McVety has also used your airwaves to call Islam \"a danger in our midst,\" and suggested that the people of Haiti brought the January 2010 earthquake on themselves for believing in witchcraft and voodoo. Again, these comments are dangerous, and are not only a violation of broadcasting ethical standards, but also a violation of Canadian law when they're put forward across television airwaves.\n\nYou've currently removed McVety's program on a temporary basis. I urge you to pull the plug completely, and not allow your television airwaves to be used as a means for fostering violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, religion, national origin or gender identity.\n\nThank you for your time.",

    "overview": "<p>Born with full hearing, Jaye Brown became deaf as a child. She is now a well-loved American Sign Language Teacher at Shasta College in Redding, California, working to bridge the language gap between the hearing and the deaf.<br><br>Last week, Brown was shocked to learn that her contract at Redding was not going to be renewed. College officials told her that one of her students had complained about a gesture she had made, and she would not be invited back the following semester.\u00a0 Jaye Brown was also evaluated, along with her husband Calvin Brown, for her performance in the classroom using a \"Peer Evaluation\".\u00a0 This \"peer\" was a full time Spanish teacher at Shasta College.\u00a0 She was evaluated in a lab class where little instruction takes place.\u00a0 Her and her husband both received poor evaluations and Jaye was nearly immediately told her contract would not be renewed.<br><br>Distraught, J. Brown and her students say that this is a misunderstanding. American Sign Language speakers use body language, facial expressions and large gestures to communicate.

I'm also asking Shasta College to address this issue with students in order to prevent even more misunderstanding and stress among American Sign Language learners, deaf community members and their allies.\n\nI recently heard about the situation at Shasta in which Jaye Brown, a popular, qualified ASL teacher, was fired over the misunderstanding of a gesture she made. Experts who study deaf and hearing culture agree that there is a huge gulf between how deaf people and hearing people communicate, especially when it comes to gestures, body language and facial expressions. Brown, who is deaf, asserts that she was misunderstood by a student.  Later it was determined that Professor Brown was terminated due to being inappropriate in class, using rude humor, not having a first day handout available on the first day, and the complaint that was made by the student.  It is known that humor that is inappropriate to a hearing person may not at be found inappropriate by a Deaf person.  Jaye has always made an effort to explain her humor to her students, since this [humor] is something that they will encounter in the real world with Deaf people quite often.  As for the class handout, Mrs. Brown was concerned that some of her classes may be canceled.  She clearly explained her expectations consistently throughout the semester using signed, written, and verbal forms.  After 12.5 years of teaching ASL, 30 years of signing as a Deaf person, and her dedication to designing the current curriculum, Jaye Brown is more than a qualified person for this position\n\nAs an institute of higher education that seeks to be an ally for the Deaf Community, Shasta College must:\n* Address this campus controversy in a public and open manner\n* Commit to educating the student body on the differences between deaf and hearing communication\n* Offer a disclaimer on the course description informing students that Deaf Culture differs greatly from Hearing Culture and that in rare cases this humor may be found inappropriate by the hearing audience\n* Reinstate Brown's contract and make this issue a learning tool for the entire campus community.",

Rather than stop and call 911, or otherwise seek help for Dr. Milo, Erzinger fled the scene and called the Mercedes auto assistance service for help with his broken side mirror.</p><p>A month ago, Eagle County DA Mark Hurlbert announced a plea agreement with Erzinger, against the wishes of Dr. Milo, because he was worried that Erzinger may be unable to keep his job, where he is dedicated to \"ultra high net worth individuals, their families and foundations.\"\u00a0</p><p>Hurlbert then rubbed salt into the wound when he admitted that he proposed the plea bargain before any discussion with Dr. Milo and his lawyer.</p><p>This Thursday, Judge Frederick W.

The enforcement of traffic laws should not differ depending on a driver's ability to write a check, but rather on the ability of the law to motivate drivers to drive safely. What Erzinger is accused of doing is clearly criminal, and the plea bargain sends a message to drivers that the penalties for neglecting the welfare of others on the road, causing life-altering injury, and showing no concern for the victim can be avoided with a large enough bank account.\n\nThis Thursday, please reject Martin Erzinger's plea bargain, and take a stand for justice for all.",

Please check back again for updates on further development as this petition is now ended on a high note. Although Van Goethem is able to get off free without facing any circumstances, she is defeated morally, thanks to those who signed the petition to let her know her actions were unethical and unlawful.\u00a0 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Posted: </strong><strong>December 17, 2010</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A blog on winning this email campaign and future outlook is posted on <a href=\"http://DCfoodforall.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">DCfoodforall.com</a>. Please see: \"DC Restauant Worker FIghts Green Restaurant to Get Paid\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Posted: December 20, 2010</strong></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>In a perfect world, DC Bread and Brew, which sources its ingredients from local and organic farms and growers whenever possible, is a lunch place patronized by those who care about sustainability, environment, animal rights and whatnot. One would think that being the leading toque at a restaurant of such reputation must be rewarding. In reality, the life in the 60-plus-hour workweek of Mya Zeronis, the second chef in a row to resign from the position of running the kitchen at the establishment now merely two years old, was everything but glamorous.</p>\n<p>Four months ago at DC Bread and Brew, an employee mopped the floor of the restroom inside the restaurant and left it without the sign indicating \"WET FLOOR.\" Zeronis slipped and fell hurting her arm. When she addressed her concern about workplace safety and the employee\u2019s job readiness, Teri Van Goethem, the owner, threatened to take away her job. About three weeks later, Zeronis left her post. In retaliation, Van Goethem is withholding her final paycheck.</p>\n<p>A wage claim has been filed against DC Bread and Brew. However, every time a worker files a claim for unpaid wages with the District of Columbia Department of Employment Services, how soon the worker gets paid is uncertain. In some cases, the Office of Wage-Hour may take more than one year to recover wages owed. Meanwhile, the worker\u2019s family needs food and a place to live.</p>\n<p>A member of Restaurant Opportunities Center of Washington, DC (ROC-DC) and ex student journalist previously involved with social justice and peace actions organized by Thomas Merton Center, Zeronis is dedicated to seeking justice for exploited restaurant workers like herself. Both by words and actions, she pledges to be a voice in the movement for workers' rights that will raise the bar and awareness across the industry, while she sets an example to inspire workers to speak out and empower them to be the change they wish to see. This petition was written not just to get her wages but to pave the way for others being treated unfairly by employers. In lieu of workers' collective organizing, employers get away with breaking the laws.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The following is her experience working at DC Bread and Brew where she was subject to verbal abuse by Van Goethem, the owner, and hostility from male workers who defied a woman in charge of the kitchen:</p>\n<p>\"I was excited to accept the job offer emailed to me by the owner of DC Bread and Brew. I was offered a probationary rate of pay lower than typical salary range for a head chef. Regardless, I took the opportunity to cook using mostly local and organic ingredients. The chef before me had already left and I walked into the situation where the kitchen staff was mismanaged and undisciplined for a few months due to the lack of a leader to follow.</p>\n<p>I immediately felt resistance from the predominantly male staff members who never once had seen a female chef\u2026except on TV. One of them wasn\u2019t too shy to get confrontational and question everything I did. One day, he got so hostile that I wondered why the owner allowed such behavior in the first place. The good thing was he quit a few weeks later and the rest of the staff began to back off as I had proven myself and earned respect. I still wasn\u2019t happy with the competence level of some staff members.</p>\n<p>There was this cook who clearly had no passion for putting out a meal to wow the guests and often disregarded my demand for professionalism by making sarcastic comments minimizing his own shortcomings. I turned to the owner but her response was: 'If I were to choose between you and him, I would choose him.' What\u2019s worse is that she gave someone without experience a dishwasher position whose duties would include mopping the floors. I fell on the floor he left wet. I made the right decision to walk away from this job. After all, I didn\u2019t get paid enough to get injured and miss work. I have a four-year-old who grows by the week.</p>\n<p>The owner denies she owes me wages for the last days I worked. \"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please join a number of caring individuals in signing the petition to tell Teri Van Goethem, the owner of DC Bread and Brew, that withholding wages is not only illegal and punishable by law, it\u2019s also a bad business practice. Her \"responsible\" restaurant could potentially lose customers who are unlikely to let slide a wage theft and exploitation of a restaurant worker who once prepared and cooked the meals they enjoyed at her establishment.

Her repeated requests to hire trainable new staff members who would work together harmoniously was ignored. She was not set up to succeed and became fed up with workplace politics that involve favoritism, gender bias and threats. Her sudden departure is fair and square, considering she was threatened to be fired on two separate occasions over male employees whose work performance is inferior. \n\nYou could deny all these but you\u2019re legally obligated to pay her the wages owed and now severely past due.

Whether a fetus can truly feel pain by 20 weeks is still contested, as even the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is no legitimate evidence a fetus can ever feel pain. \n\nFurthermore, the constitutionality of this law should be called into question as it clearly disregards the standard of viability that was established by the United States Supreme Court as a result of Roe vs. Wade. \n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2006, only .1 percent of all reported abortions in the state of Iowa occurred when the mother was more than 21 weeks pregnant. Most women who have late-term abortions do so because of health risks. Is changing this law worth the health and safety of the women in your state? \n\nI ask that you please put a stop to the passage of this bill and allow women continued access to safe abortions under the current Iowa law.",

Alberto Osorio fue asesinado en un aparente crimen de odio anti-gay. Este crimen eleva a diecis\u00e9is el n\u00famero de personas asesinadas por causa de su orientaci\u00f3n sexual o identidad de g\u00e9nero desde enero de 2009. Le pido que condene todos los cr\u00edmenes por homofobia, lleve a cabo una exhaustiva y justa investigaci\u00f3n del asesinato de Alberto Osorio, y asegure que sus perpetradores sean encontrados y castigados con toda la extensi\u00f3n de la ley. Adem\u00e1s solicitamos que el Ministro del Interior y otras autoridades peruanas tomen todas las medidas para evitar que estos cr\u00edmenes ocurran nuevamente en el futuro.\n\nEl 20 de septiembre de 2010 a las 9:30 am, el cuerpo del Sr. Osorio fue encontrado por su madre, Esther Castillo, en su apartamento en Avenida Santa Mercedes 374, II etapa de la urbanizaci\u00f3n Palao en el distrito de San Mart\u00edn de Porres, en la zona norte de Lima. \u00c9l, hab\u00eda sido amarrado a su cama con un cable y los hematomas en su cuerpo indicaban que hab\u00eda sido golpeado antes de ser estrangulado. \n\nAlberto Juan Osorio Castillo, era periodista y presidente de VIHDARTE Centro de Desarrollo Participativo para los Derechos y la Salud, una organizaci\u00f3n de la sociedad civil que \u00e9l fund\u00f3 en 2001 para defender y promover los derechos de las personas viviendo con VIH/SIDA (PVVS). Como representante de este colectivo fue nombrado miembro del Comit\u00e9 Nacional Multisectorial de Lucha contra el SIDA (CONAMUSA). \n\nAdem\u00e1s de Alberto Osorio, al menos otras ocho personas gay y trans fueron asesinadas en 2010  en iguales circunstancias de acuerdo a Bolet\u00edn Diversidad, una organizaci\u00f3n peruana que monitorea la violencia por homofobia. Seg\u00fan el Reporte de DDHH de las personas LGTB emitido por la organizaci\u00f3n Bolet\u00edn Diversidad, Ra\u00edz 2.0, al menos otras siete personas gays y trans tambi\u00e9n fueron asesinadas en 2009 . Estos cr\u00edmenes repiten el mismo patr\u00f3n usado en el de Alberto Osorio: el perpetrador seduce a la v\u00edctima, entra a su hogar y la golpea, mata y le roba. \n\nPocos casos de asesinatos a gays o personas trans ocurridos el a\u00f1o pasado han concluido en un juicio. Seg\u00fan activistas LGTB de Per\u00fa la falla en el enjuiciamiento de estos cr\u00edmenes se basa en la homofobia. Tomamos en serio la preocupaci\u00f3n de los activistas LGTB de Per\u00fa que creen que la falla en la resoluci\u00f3n de estos cr\u00edmenes es resultado de prejuicios homof\u00f3bicos, como en el caso de Marco Antonio Gallego, en el cual las organizaciones han argumentado que la falta de cargos espec\u00edficos por cr\u00edmenes de odio anti-gay resultaron en penas d\u00e9biles a los perpetradores. Ellos afirman que las investigaciones y los cargos criminales que no consideran la orientaci\u00f3n sexual o la identidad de g\u00e9nero de las v\u00edctimas como un potencial motivo del crimen facilita la impunidad de los perpetradores, alienta la discriminaci\u00f3n en el sistema judicial y conduce a m\u00e1s cr\u00edmenes contra las personas LGTB. \n\nAunque no existe legislaci\u00f3n en Per\u00fa que sancione cr\u00edmenes basados en la orientaci\u00f3n sexual y/o identidad de g\u00e9nero, el Art\u00edculo 2 de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de Per\u00fa garantiza el derecho a la vida, a su identidad, a su integridad moral, ps\u00edquica y  f\u00edsica y a su libre desarrollo y bienestar.

La ley 28237, que entr\u00f3 en vigencia en diciembre de 2004 e instituye un nuevo C\u00f3digo Procesal Constitucional para el pa\u00eds, reconoce la no discriminaci\u00f3n por orientaci\u00f3n sexual como objeto de protecci\u00f3n legal, reconociendo a las minor\u00edas sexuales como un grupo protegido,  y permite presentar recursos de amparo en casos de discriminaci\u00f3n.\n\nPer\u00fa, adem\u00e1s, es signatario de tratados regionales e internacionales de Derechos Humanos que garantizan los derechos a la vida, a la no discriminaci\u00f3n, igualdad, seguridad de la persona y protecci\u00f3n contra la tortura como el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol\u00edticos, La Convenci\u00f3n Americana de Derechos Humanos y otros instrumentos como el Carta Andina de Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de los Derechos Humanos en donde expresamente se enuncia la decisi\u00f3n de combatir la discriminaci\u00f3n por orientaci\u00f3n sexual. \n\nLo comprometo a reconocer su obligaci\u00f3n ante estos tratados con relaci\u00f3n al asesinato de Alberto Osorio y le solicito que:\n\u2022 El ministro del Interior y el Ministro de Justicia, junto a otras autoridades peruanas de relevancia condenen p\u00fablicamente el crimen de Alberto Juan Osorio Castillo y todos los cr\u00edmenes de odio por homofobia. \n\u2022 Que la Polic\u00eda y el Ministerio de Justicia lleven adelante una completa y justa investigaci\u00f3n por el asesinato de Alberto Osorio y todos los dem\u00e1s cr\u00edmenes por homofobia no resueltos llevando a juicio a sus perpetradores con toda la fuerza de la ley.\n\u2022 La Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo del Per\u00fa colecte, analice y efect\u00fae un reporte sobre los detalles y penas por cr\u00edmenes de odio por homofobia.\n\u2022 Que la polic\u00eda lleve adelante una capacitaci\u00f3n de sensibilizaci\u00f3n que refuerce la prevenci\u00f3n, monitoreo, investigaci\u00f3n y registro de los cr\u00edmenes relacionados con la orientaci\u00f3n sexual, la identidad de g\u00e9nero y el estatus de VIH/Sida.\n\nComo s\u00edmbolo del compromiso del gobierno de Per\u00fa con la justicia y equidad para todos, sin distinci\u00f3n de su orientaci\u00f3n sexual o identidad de g\u00e9nero o estatus de HIV/Sida, le solicito dar a este asunto la urgente atenci\u00f3n que se merece. \n\nCordialmente,",

Ignoring their conscience, individuals use dogs to make money and to entertain themselves. It is a truly sad practice that must end. How would you like it if I trained you from the first day you were born to kill anyone that resists you? What if I forced you to fight to your death? I think most would say no. Animals should be treated the same way! Just because humans are higher on the food chain does not make it acceptable to torture animals to their death!\n\nWhat You Can Do To Stop Dog Fighting:\n\nIf you are under the suspicion that dog fighting is occurring in your neighborhood, call the police, local animal shelter such as the Humane Society or animal control. Never try to be a hero and protest against the dog fighting ring alone. The individuals involved with dog fighting are often armed and dangerous!\n\nAnimal Shelters: Fighting Back at Dog Fighting\n\nThe dogs rescued from dog fighting rings or other types of animal abuse cases are sent to animal shelters. That is why it is so important for you to support your local animal shelters. Please consider to adopt a dog or a cat. If you cannot adopt a pet, donate your car, animal toys and food to help the organization provide a second chance for many deserving animals.",

Tell the U.S. EPA to bring the Navy\u2019s ship ocean dumping program in-line with current laws, laws that all citizens of the United States must abide by. Your support will make the difference!\u00a0</p>\n<p>A report by the Basel Action Network,\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://ban.org/library/Dishonorable%20Disposal_BAN%20Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dishonorable Disposal: The Case Against Dumping U.S. Naval Vessels at Sea</a></em>,\u00a0and subsequent investigation by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/03/ap-enterprise-navy-sinkex-raises-pollution-fear/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Associated Press</em></a>, uncovered the wasteful legacy of the U.S. Navy's ship sinking program. This comprehensive analysis of ship ocean disposal by way of target practice exercise cites toxicological data demonstrating polluted waterways, and an economic analysis revealing lost recycling jobs, wasted taxpayer dollars and squandered resources at the center of the government's ship disposal program.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon quietly pulled back plans to sink the USS Forrestal and three other aircraft carriers in 2011, deciding instead to recycle these vessels domestically. However, the Navy ignored the rationale that led them to that decision and sunk four ships in 2012, and is moving ahead with plans to sink two more ships by sinking exercise (SINKEX) in the pristine waters of the Hawaiian islands in July 2014.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The EPA and Navy admit that toxic chemicals are deposited into the marine environment as a result of ship sinking operations, including asbestos, lead paint, antifouling paint containing tributyltin (TBT), polybrominated diphenyl esters (PBDEs) and notably polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a suspected carcinogen that has been targeted for global phase-out and destruction under the Stockholm Convention. However, the EPA and the Navy have not yet assessed the impacts of this toxic dumping to any degree of certainty, nor do they have plans to assess the ramifications of such dumping. Yet the sinking program continues unobstructed.</p>\n<p>In 1998-99, EPA revised the general SINKEX permit to allow the Navy to continue the SINKEX program with exemptions to the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), essentially giving the Navy a pass to leave intact solid PCB contaminated materials on SINKEX vessels for deep sinking. Following this exemption, the Navy quickly escalated the program. From 1970-1999 SINKEX accounted for approximately 8% of all vessel disposals, but from 2000-2010 (following the TSCA exemption), sinkings accounted for approximately 65% of all disposals, with over 100 ships being dumped in that decade alone. These ships contained an estimated 600,000 tons of recyclable steel, copper and aluminum, worth an estimated half a billion dollars in scrap had the vessels been recycled.</p>\n<p>The Navy has taken great advantage of the exemptions EPA granted them and escalated the ocean dumping program, presumably to save on costs related to PCB compliance under TSCA, which is applicable to all other ship disposal methods. But EPA has done nothing to restrict the program or improve the remediation requirements by limiting exemptions that were granted over 13 years ago. In fact, in January 2014, the EPA explicitly stated that the Navy can sink up to 100 lbs. of pure molecular PCBs with each SINKEX target vessel.</p>\n<p><strong>Join our call.</strong> Tell the U.S. EPA to bring the Navy\u2019s ocean dumping program in-line with current laws, laws that all citizens of the United States must abide by.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Thank you for your support.</p>\n<p>Basel Action Network</p>",

    "letter_body": "RE: Navy SINKEX\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI am writing to submit public comment asking EPA to intervene and bring the Navy's SINKEX program in line with U.S. and international law. I believe the EPA's support for this wasteful ocean dumping program, and the exemptions granted to the Navy under past administrations, present a troubling situation. Ocean dumping of toxic pollutants is simply irresponsible when waste can be responsibly managed and contained in land-based facilities. Adding insult to injury, the dumping squanders tons of critical metal resources that could otherwise be recycled in the domestic marketplace, lessening the demand on primary metal resources and related environmental impacts. \n\nI urge EPA to consider the big picture here - the dumping of Navy wastes into nature for any purpose sends a very dangerous cultural message that the natural world, and in particular our marine environment, can be exploited as the solution to our growing waste problem. The Obama Administration\u2019s Lead by Example mandates and the widely accepted waste management hierarchy should guide practical and principled policy decisions here. \n\nThe Navy should at the very least be required to follow the law, as everyone else is required. Why should the Navy be granted exemptions to PCB remediation requirements that industry and all citizens of the United States must strictly follow? It is our Government that not only enforces the law on its citizens, but it is our Government that should be expected to comply with the law in the same manner as its citizens. \n\nThe environmental benefits of recycling are important to consider, especially as the Obama Administration has gone out of its way to promote recycling through Executive Order, as well as promoting initiatives for healthy seas. \n\nThe ships currently being readied for SINKEX \u2013 the Ogden, Fresno, and Tuscaloosa \u2013 are all likely to contain a host of hazardous materials within their construction given their 1960\u2019s vintage, yet the Navy can prepare them and sink them without direct oversight by EPA or any other agency. In fact, EPA has granted them general authority by way of permit, to leave intact regulated concentrations of PCBs for ocean dumping. This is not sufficient to ensure pollution is minimized to protect the environment and in particular the vulnerable ocean ecosystem. \n\nI ask the EPA to take the lead and correct the errors in judgment made by past administrations, errors that allow ocean dumping of hazardous materials into our seas on the Obama Administration\u2019s watch. As a proud citizen of the United States of America, I urge you to \u201cLead by Example\u201d, just as our President has directed you, and clean up this run-away program.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

Your action brings hope to people across the country who are fighting this destructive practice.  Thank you for listening to the outpouring of citizens who asked you to put caution first and place the burden of proof on industry when our health and future are at risk.\n\nUnfortunately your order excludes vertical hydraulic fracturing wells, because apparently you equate vertical fracking with conventional drilling, when vertical fracking is anything but conventional, and carries many of the same inherent risks to public health and safety as horizontal hydro-fracking.  Vertical hydraulic fracturing wells in the Marcellus and Utica Shales were intentionally included in S.8129-B/A.11443-B, which passed the Legislature with overwhelming bi-partisan support.\n\nThe inclusion of Marcellus and Utica vertical wells  was in direct response to the gas industry\u2019s threats to circumvent any moratorium on horizontal high-volume hydraulic fracturing by applying for permits to drill vertical wells in lieu of horizontal wells.  Because under current spacing laws, this would potentially allow for as many as sixteen vertical wells to be drilled per square mile in the Marcellus Shale, this could result in even greater environmental impacts than those being evaluated in the SGEIS.\n\nMoreover, the Legislature did not want to create a situation in which a natural gas company could apply for a permit to drill vertically in a formation that is the subject of the on-going SEQRA process with the intention of subsequently converting such well to a horizontal well upon the completion of that process. The legislators were concerned this would create the potential for the industry to do an \u201cend-run\u201d around SEQRA by creating a fait accompli, whereby the NYSDEC would be compelled to permit the conversion of a vertical well to a horizontal well once the vertical well was already in the ground.  This would contravene the very purpose of the SGEIS process that the Governor directed.\n\nFinally, the Legislature understood that it was in fact vertical wells drilled into the Marcellus Shale in PA - including in the much-publicized case of Dimock - that resulted in serious environmental and health issues, including widespread groundwater contamination.\n\nYou had the opportunity to become a true national environmental hero by signing a real moratorium into law but instead chose to listen to the claims and misinformation campaign of the gas industry. This loophole you created by excluding the permitting of high-volume vertical hydraulic fracturing creates a dangerous situation subject to the gas industry\u2019s exploitation.\n\nPlease consider issuing a new Executive Order that will address this situation, by imposing a moratorium on the issuance of any new hydraulic fracturing permits - whether vertical or horizontal - in the Marcellus and Utica shales. The current Executive Order must be expanded to actually protect our health and safety.  Furthermore, vertical hyraulic fracturing should also be taken into account in the revision of the dSGEIS, and final regulations adopted should apply to both vertical and horizontal hydraulic fracturing.\n\nWe are confident that this error will be corrected so that we can move forward to create a strong energy plan for New York's future.\n\nThank you,",

Leahy had concerns about Haliburton's business  practices. To say Leahy has some progressive chops is putting it mildly.</p>\n<p>That's what makes it all the more disappointing that in the wake of the Smithsonian and the National Portrait Gallery <a href=\"http://blog/view/national_portrait_gallery_caving_to_anti-gay_activists_censors_lgbt_art_exhibit\" rel=\"nofollow\">censoring a piece of artwork by David Wojnarowicz</a>, Leahy has remained fairly quiet. Leahy is a member of the board of regents at the Smithsonian, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/opinion/12rich.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">and was called out by Frank Rich</a> this past weekend in a searing column that suggested that the National  Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian were committing an act nothing  short of gay bashing by hiding the artwork of Wojnarowicz.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.burlingtonfreepress.com/politics/2010/12/14/sen-patrick-leahy-and-the-smithsonian-regents/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sen.

After all, we wouldn't want every piece of art in the Smithsonian to go  before a board of regents before being displayed.</p>\n<p>But Leahy's  quote also has a bit of tone deafness to it, in that the Senator clearly  has some muscle in Washington (he is the second most senior legislator  in the U.S. Senate, after all). As a member of the board of regents,  Sen. Leahy could have issued a statement like this: \"While I don't think  members of the board of regents should be consulted in matters like  this, I am saddened to see the Smithsonian turning back the clock to the  1980s, when so many people living with HIV/AIDS were targeted by  anti-gay activists and forced or bullied into hiding. I urge the  Smithsonian and the National Portrait Gallery to live up to its mission  of capitalizing '<a href=\"http://www.si.edu/About/Mission\" rel=\"nofollow\">on the richness inherent in differences</a>' and showing art that challenges our way of thinking and captures a community of voices.\"</p>\n<p>Think of the power a statement like that would have delivered, as opposed to: \"Eh, censor away folks.\"</p>\n<p>Send  Senator Leahy a message that his voice is critical here, and that he  should condemn efforts to keep the artwork of LGBT people and those  living (or who have lived) with HIV/AIDS from the public.</p>",

Now they have acted on that threat. The few Republicans in the Senate willing to vote yes on repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell the last time Senate Democrats tried to repeal this discriminatory law voted no.\n\nThese Republicans voted no just because the tax cuts for their super rich puppetmasters hadn't been passed.

    "letter_body": "We, as postgraduate and research students, support the staff of Macquarie University in their bid to draw fair pay for the high quality work that they do. This is not just about higher salaries, but about ensuring the university maintains its reputation as a major teaching and research institution, remains an attractive workplace, provides quality education to students, and is in the best possible position to meet the Macquarie@50 goals.\n\nOur key concerns are as follows:\n-\tThe refusal of the Macquarie management team to conduct enterprise bargaining in good faith with the NTEU. \n-\tThe proposed 4% pay increase for academic staff is too low in light of the university's strong financial position \n-\tThe increasing workloads on staff, with a 10 percent increase in enrolments in 2009 being matched by only a 0.26% (sic) increase in  academic staff\n-\tThe standing down of staff members who are standing up for their rights and for quality education for students\n-\tThe inappropriate use of the media and university-wide announcements to misinform students (as well as the broader community)\n\nAs research  students, we are concerned about these issues because: it decreases the appeal of Macquarie to quality staff; the casualisation of the academic workforce shrinks the pool of potential supervisors; increased casualisation has coincided with larger tutorial and workshop classes; and all of these issues decrease the quality of the university\u2019s teaching and research output. This devalues the pursuit of academic knowledge. \n\nWe deplore the present situation because not only does it show contempt towards existing academic staff, but towards us \u2013 the future. We are calling on the university to seriously consider where it\u2019s priorities lie as an educational institution - especially with the Vice Chancellor receiving $32 000 per fortnight (or 37 MQRES scholarships per year), an obscene amount for an employee of a public institution.\n\nWe, the undersigned postgraduate and research students, wish to express our full support to academic staff standing up for better working conditions and a better teaching, learning and research environment. We ask that the University immediately re-instate staff that have been stood down and resume negotiations in good faith by addressing the concerns raised by the NTEU and which our letter has re-iterated.",

    "letter_body": "In July of 2005, I was in need of disposable cash to complete renovations to a duplex and fourplex that I owned with another person.  A business associate and I signed a (1) year agreement to do this type of business in the Houston area.  He then wired me $25,000 into one of my bank accounts. After buying $3,300,000 worth of real estate and finishing the renovations to (1) house and placing it on the market, I then started (2) more houses to renovate which  had to be totally gutted out and were very extensive rehab jobs.  As I was completing one of them, I ran out of money primarily due to the real estate market and not being able to sell (2) homes I had on the market, coupled with the fact 3 people who placed contracts on homes had backed out.  I also experienced other people back out on real estate deals and this really hurt my financial well being my first year in business.\n\nOnce I saw that these unforeseen experiences would not afford me the ability to;\n a)  complete the renovations,  b)  make the mortgage payments and  c)  operate day to day business expenses for all these properties, I informed my business associate what was happening and that I would at least sell the properties at wholesale to get his $25,000 back to him.  To which he said he understood but would not lift a finger to help.  After a month or so, I informed him that the properties would get foreclosed on and offered to give him one and sign over the Warranty Deed solely in his name.  He refused and just wanted his money back.  To which I informed him was not possible, and he said, \"we'll see what happens when the contract expires\".  In October of 2006,  I was contacted by a detective from the police department stating that this business associate had written a complaint against me stating that I took his money and ran.  I informed this detective of all the properties purchased etc. and offered to share all information at my office or her office.  I did not hear from this detective until months later when she said she was putting the file aside.  I even talked with a couple of my attorneys and explained the situation and they both said it is a civil matter, not a criminal matter.\n\nI moved back to Washington State, to be closer to my kids and get back into the workforce in engineering.\nI needed to get my finances and life into order after the failure in the real estate business.  While doing so, my ex and I were experiencing relational trouble and there was an instance whereby I found the need to call the police after asking her to leave my residence as she would not, and was causing a disruption with my neighbors and I. Once arriving, the police asked for my license while they ran a check and found I had an unknown warrant out of Texas and they arrested me.  After being extradited back to Texas to answer the charges against me, I could not make bail.  The court system and jail system in Texas is very corrupt and make people wait sometimes up to 3 years before seeing a court room.  After being in jail for approximately a year, I decided to take a plea agreement for time served.  I took this because the court appointed attorney for my case was not representing me at all.  He would not send to get my files to prove my innocence or interview me for all of the facts surrounding the case. Even the Prosecuting Attorney stated that I was not guilty of taking my business associates money and running, but his job is to get a conviction and found only one thing that I did wrong.  I had (3) bank accounts, (2) of which were just recently opened which goes to show I  was not using much money at the beginning this partnership and to note, I  gave him the bank information to the account I had for some time that I used at a regular basis.  I had plenty of cash going out of the other two bank accounts for mortgages, materials, contractors, permits, tools, rentals and day to day business expenses, but because the account that he wired into had personal expenses as well, they decided to charge me with Misappropriation of Fiduciary.  In considering my options I  wanted to take it to trial and would have if I had proper representation.  I took the plea offering because if I went to trial with the representation I had and without all of my evidence, I could face 6-8 years in prison for something I didn't do and was not willing to risk that.  I have lived a life of being a law abiding citizen and have worked hard for every dollar that comes into my hand.\n\nReasons why I was in jail:\nI had an ex wife whom went into my computer, took all of my passwords to my online accounts for my personal emails, business email, utility bills, cell phone and home phones, bank accounts and mortgage accounts.   She went online and into each account and changed my mailing address to her P.O. Box.  She also went to the extreme of filling out a change of address card to forward her mail to her P.O. Box,  and checked the box \u201cFamily\u201c instead of \u201cIndividual\u201d and having all of my mail forwarded and delivered to her P.O. Box. This card is on file at the local U.S. Post Office.  The Local Postal clerk informed me I could not put in a change of address from her P.O. Box to my home address, but they would make the necessary changes to get my mail delivered in house.  But she had already received one of my ATM cards to her P.O. Box and used it for some unauthorized charges, and also opened up a credit card in my name.  When I got the card I went to look it up online and her P.O. Box was listed as the address.  But my forwarding address was in place and started getting my mail a year after she started all of this criminal activity.  She went into most of my online accounts and changed the address from my home address to her P.O. Box.  She got phone numbers from my cell bill and started calling numbers to find out whose numbers were there.  I even had an instant message on yahoo saved whereby she admitted that \u201cEverything happening to you is from me\u201d. \n\n She also was removed from my property while I was asleep during the hours of 2am-2:30am for trespassing and disturbing the peace.  This woman was literally stalking me and intruding into every area of my life.  I had so much evidence documented and all the police did was ask her a couple of questions and her answers were not even related to the complaints against her.  The Detective who asked her these questions was the same person investigating the complaint from my former business partner.  I was in continual communications with this Detective and invited her to my office or I would go into her office and show her everything I had done.  Even though this was not required.  She put my file away and I assumed what she told me was to be true, that my file was being put to the side as a civil matter.  \n\nI  wrote three letters of complaints to the Police about my former spouse.  Because there was no actions by the police whatsoever, I wrote a letter to the Chief of Police informing him of my displeasure in our local police department and their investigation on the crime committed against me and also felt that it was a very bias investigation due to the false complaint against me.  I also forwarded this to the Mayor and the Houston Chronicle suggesting them to investigate this legal system in Missouri City and the injustice that was going on. Eventually the investigating Detective retired and my case was picked up by the Chief of Police. Once he saw this file and who the complaint was against, he sent it over to the District Attorney\u2019s office for prosecution without any further delay and no further investigation ensued. He even stated a lot of assumptions all without any investigation.  It could have been looked up very easily in both Harris County and Fort Bend county Property Records that I owned property and looked at the property, asked a few questions and found out that YES, I was  buying property, YES I was spending lots of money restoring these properties and YES, I had them on the market. \n\nMy belief is that this Chief of Police went beyond his call of duty to put me away for calling out his police dept. out for a very poor investigation on a crime that happened to me. I have received the investigation report from the Missouri City Police Dept. who received the complaint from my former business associate. This report does have the Chief of Police admitting that I did make a complaint against his police dept and their lack of investigating a crime that happened to me. I am currently awaiting some more documents and investigation work to be done to bring a full law suit against my former business partner, the Chief of Police and possibly my former landlords for their part in this horrible event that has happened to me and have my named cleared of all false criminal charges that were made against me. There has been a Civil suit for $3,334,000 filed against the City of Missouri City for failure to investigate a crime and false imprisonment to clear my name of all wrong doing.It is currently at the U.S. District Court, Texas Southern Division, Houston in front of a Magistrate Judge to put all efforts into turning my conviction around and recovering as best as possible, all that I lost during the time I was jailed. Because of my background check, I can't get a job at even Toys R Us and support my family and have to depend on my dad who is retired and cannot afford to take care of me. For over 20 years, I have been working hard without much break in between jobs, working in Engineering with a great report from companies and have been living a honest life, working for everything I get, sometimes 3 times as hard as most people. I have given much time and money to churches and people in need as I can. We need to put an end to our government and especially Police Departments to live up to their responsibilitites and be accountable for thier wrongful actions and get the corrupt out and the good back in!",

First, domestic abuse is actually two to four times more common in police families than the rest of the population. This means your department, rather than confront a serious problem, is putting police families increasingly in harm's way. Failure to take domestic violence seriously only emboldens abusers to act again, knowing they will not lose their jobs for it. \n\nLastly, the Nashville Police Department has in the last few years (as was reported by The Tennessean last summer) vastly increased the number of domestic violence cases it failed to resolve or dismissed. Indeed, in the last several years, the number of unresolved cases went from about 200 to 5,600. This only goes to show that both on the force and in the community, domestic violence is not taken seriously. Imagine now a victim of abuse calls the police, only to find the responding officer is sympathetic to the abuser. \n\nFor the health and safety of the community, please re-evaluate your policies towards domestic violence cases on the force and in the community. On the force, there should be a zero-tolerance policy so that police are aware of the consequences of their violent actions, and so that violent abusers are not allowed to keep their gun. Once DV is taken seriously among police officers, then it can also take care of its community by making sure abusers are punished and victims remain safe.\n\nSincerely,",

While the shelter claims no \"adoptable\" animal is sent to the University, other sources state healthy and behaviorally sound animals are sent. \n\nNo animal -- adoptable or not -- deserves to suffer. Furthermore, the relationship creates distrust within the community. A shelter should offer a safe place for homeless animals and lost pets, not be a place of fear. \n\nIn 2008, Brisbane City Council ended their relationship with the University of Queensland and no longer sends homeless pets to the school. I urge you to follow in their footsteps and end Logan City's agreement with the University.\n\nThank you.",

    "letter_body": "We, the undersigned parents, students, family members, and friends of the Malcolm Price Lab School community, do hereby petition that the use of pesticides be discontinued on and near the Malcolm Price Lab School grounds in order to create and maintain a safe and sustainable environment for our children. Several public health and sustainability concerns underlie this request.\n\nIn a systematic review of medical research, the Ontario College of Family Physicians (2007) concluded: \u201cStudies looking at pesticide use and cancer have shown a positive relationship between exposure to pesticides and the development of some cancers, particularly in children\u201d (p. 1705). In addition, a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics found statistically significant relationships between the insecticide Chlorpyrifos (used on corn, beans, wheat, fruits, and vegetables, and for indoor pest control) and delays in learning rates, reduced physical coordination, and behavioral problems in children, especially attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n\nBecause medical research has determined that potentially serious risks to health exist for children who are exposed to pesticides, and because practical, effective, and pesticide-free alternatives are available, we believe that the application of these chemicals should be discontinued immediately in and near our school. This is especially the case in situations where pesticides are used for largely cosmetic reasons.\n\nWe believe that the elimination of pesticides on and near the Malcolm Price Lab School grounds also supports our recently reaffirmed institutional values. In particular, our university community is dedicated to supporting policies and practices which ensure the following, as outlined in the 2010-2015 UNI Strategic Plan:\n\nCommunity \u2013 an ethical, caring and safe community characterized by civility\n\nDiversity \u2013 a welcoming community that celebrates pluralism, multiculturalism, and the unique contributions of each group \n\nSustainability \u2013 an attractive, well-maintained campus environment that enhances the living and learning experience with an emphasis on environmental stewardship\n\nMalcolm Price Lab School parents are offering to work with UNI officials to develop safer solutions.\n\n\nReferences\n\nBassil, K.

Meredith Corporation\u2019s apparent lack of information regarding the types of advertisements you are placing in your publications is very frustrating. While these ads might be described by the tobacco company as \u201cprevention\u201d materials, we know NO tobacco company campaign has produced solid evidence of preventing youth tobacco use.

    "overview": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the heels of a <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-7412.ZS.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">landmark</a> Supreme Court decision this spring, progressive lawmakers are scrambling across the country to challenge the practice of sentencing juveniles to life in prison. In Nebraska, State Senator Brenda Council is hoping the SOCTUS ruling will propel her second attempt at legislation banning juvenile life without parole. She knows her view on the matter is unpopular in her state, having pulled a similar measure out of the lineup last year when she knew it was doomed to fail. But, she\u2019s committed to the cause and so are several groups in the state\u2014ready to step out as leaders in juvenile justice reform.</p>\n<p>This past week, Sen. Council and local organizations including the <a href=\"http://juvenilejusticenebraska.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nebraska Coalition for the Fair Sentencing of Youth</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.voicesforchildren.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Voices For Children In Nebraska</a> gathered to <a href=\"http://www.omaha.com/article/20101214/NEWS01/712139834/0\" rel=\"nofollow\">discuss</a> how best to promote their agenda, how to get supporters in a state that is largely attached to a sort of no mercy ideology, even among juveniles. There\u2019s no doubt the battle will be an uphill climb, though some pressure from activists across the country and <a href=\"http://Change.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Change.org</a> members could certainly help.</p>\n<p>The Nebraska state prison system is relatively small\u2014with an average daily population somewhere <a href=\"http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Prison_Count_2010.pdf?n=880\" rel=\"nofollow\">around</a> 4,500. And of these thousands of inmates, only 26 were sentenced to life in prison for offenses committed as youth. Nebraska is one of the few states that allows children as young as 13 to be sentenced to life without parole, kids arguably not even old enough to understand the gravity of homicide, let alone make a conscious, rational decision to commit it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0While opponents of this and similar measures will undoubtedly hear \u201cFree all the killer kids!\u201d\u2014that isn\u2019t hardly what this is about. This is about giving children an <em>opportunity</em> to show their rehabilitation by providing them a chance at parole. This isn\u2019t a guarantee of future release, merely the hope that if you do right and learn from your mistakes you will have a chance to show such progress to a parole board. Ultimately, it would be the parole board\u2019s choice to grant release or withhold it.</p>\n<p>Show your support for Nebraskans who want to end juvenile life without parole by signing this petition and forwarding it to your friends. \u00a0As Douglas A. Berman points out over at <a href=\"http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2010/12/nebraska-lawmaker-seeking-to-end-lwop-for-juveniles-in-state.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentencing Law and Policy</a>, Nebraska is a unicameral system. This means Council will only need to convince 29 out of 49 Nebraska lawmakers to pass her bill.

Though this would reduce prison costs, it goes beyond budgetary concerns and is simply the right thing to do.\n\nPeople convicted of offenses as children should have the opportunity to prove their rehabilitation at some point regardless of the offense. Justice Kennedy wrote about such life sentences in the majority opinion, \u201cthis judgment is not appropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender\u2019s capacity for change and limited moral culpability.\u201d I argue that a juvenile\u2019s capacity for change and limited moral culpability applies regardless of the offense.\n\nI do not wish to minimize the crimes of juveniles who commit homicide, nor bring any additional suffering to the victim\u2019s families. However, I do believe that all people sentenced to life as children should have the opportunity to show their rehabilitation and \u201ccapacity for change\u201d to a parole board at some point in their sentence. This isn\u2019t a guaranteed release, but a reason for hope and a motivator for change in an offender\u2019s life. \n\nPlease end juvenile life without parole sentences in Nebraska and do so post haste.\n\nThank you for your concern in this matter.",

As a result of this disproportionate cut, the activities of the Network are in serious jeopardy.\n \nWe are one of the largest student organizations on campus, with several hundred members, and the goals of the SBU Student Cat Network represent commonly-held values among the population of people who contribute Student Activity Fees. The slashing of the budgeted allocation to this group shows that these values have been dismissed by USG\u2019s governing body, and we are angry.\n\n \nWe assert, in no uncertain terms, that as members of the SBU Student Cat Network, we uphold its multi-faceted mission:\n\na.       To humanely care for and to control the population of feral and stray cats living on SBU\u2019s campus. (We acknowledge that feral cat populations on university campuses typically arise when animals are dumped at the end of the school year by campus residents.)\n\nb.      To provide educational opportunities by veterinarians and naturalists for our student members, and to prepare interested members for application to relevant graduate and professional programs.\n\nc.       To match relevant members to volunteer opportunities in the surrounding region that can strengthen candidacy for graduate training programs, professional training programs, fellowships, and jobs.\n\n \nOur own needs are met in three important ways:\n\na.       This organization serves important personal values, similar to the way that other clubs founded on religious or cultural heritage do.  We want to be able to use some of our Student Activity Fees to save lives. This is what we care about, and it is at least as important to us as throwing USG-sponsored parties or buying equipment for recreational activities.\n\nb.      Several meetings throughout the year allow us to socialize with and learn from like-minded peers and experts. This is similar to other clubs who are founded on other types of common interest.\n\nc.       Through this organization, we have access to important experiences we can include on our resum\u00e9s, including volunteering, working with outside members of the community, and observing surgeries at local veterinary offices. In addition to being an extraordinarily effective force for good in the world, this organization provides unique pre-professional opportunities.\n\n \nWe have done amazing things on campus for 8 years, and we serve as a model for other similar student groups around the country. We are nationally known and have won national recognition, yet we operate on a shoestring, constantly desperate for the funds we need to do our work. We can\u2019t continue to operate without substantial backing from the USG; we simply can\u2019t.\n\n \nManagement of the campus cat colonies is not something that can survive with on-again, off-again support. One year of reduced trap-and-neuter activity will lead to many years of playing catch-up with animals that are having litters twice a year.\n\n \nIf the members of the USG governing body have any doubts about our personal commitment to this cause, or about whether our fees are properly used for purposes of the humane care of the animals we care so deeply about, we urge you to meet with our officers to request further clarification. In the meantime, the cats who live on their own on campus will struggle through another brutal winter.",

The first step would be to move Morgan to a semi-natural site in the Netherlands, where Morgan would live in a much larger enclosure in a sea-water environment. This would better prepare Morgan for a return to the ocean. The plan is endorsed by many conservation groups around the world. \n\nIt is in Morgan's best interest to return her to the wild, and the next step is to move her to a semi-natural site and out of the concrete tank at Harderwijk Dolfinarium. \n\nThank you.",

Following a brief series of high profile, far-right attacks-- and despite having not received a single complaint from the public-- the Smithsonian Museum pulled the piece \"A Fire in My Belly\" from an exhibition titled Hide/Seek at the National Portrait Gallery a few weeks ago.<br><br>The work in question is a 10-second video that shows ants crawling on a cross.\u00a0 The work is meant to illustrate the suffering of an AIDS victim in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The artist of the piece is David Wojnarowicz, who died of AIDS-related complications in 1992, at the age of 37.<br><br>This piece was considered important and valuable to the Hide/Seek collection when it was curated and when it opened in October.\u00a0 What changed on November 30, when the piece was taken out of the display? Whose voices did the board of the Smithsonian place above its own professional judgment?<br><br>As it happens, they were listening to people like Bill Donohue, Glenn Beck and John Boehner, who were once again using gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people for social division \u2013 and of course, fundraising. These are the same people who have been fighting tooth and nail against employment protections for LGBT people. These are the same people who didn't want the LGBT community added to hate crimes protections. These are the same people who are trying to keep the men and women of our military in the closet - and now they're throwing works of art in there with them.<br><br>Anti-gay activists and politicians are now setting their sights on the entire LGBT exhibit and the Smithsonian itself.\u00a0\u00a0 Opponents of the Hide/Seek exhibit have since also shared their disgust at images in the exhibit that feature men kissing.<br><br>Throughout the course of history, art has served to provoke thought and challenge opinion.\u00a0 This work is a powerful statement about a critical period in the history of America's LGBT community, which should not be hidden from public view because of the grandstanding of a few disingenuous critics and politicians.<br><br>Several weeks ago, GLAAD placed an op-ed in the Washington Post by a faculty member of Yale's Divinity School who said, \"The truly blasphemous abomination is the church's initial reluctance, even refusal to care for, speak out about, and show dignity to literal bodies of real people with HIV/AIDS.\" Patrick Evans wrote, \"The religious and political leaders who used World AIDS Day in this holy season of Advent to cultivate political power and raise money by focusing on 11 seconds of an artistic work by a man who died of AIDS in 1992 would do well to remember the clear and unequivocal words of the savior whose wounds they are so quick to save from crawling insects.\"<br><br>But we all need to do more and raise our voices even louder.

    "overview": "<p><em>Update December 18, 2010:\u00a0</em><em>Councilman Brian Whitley\u00a0contacted the Parks Department to follow-up on concerns about restrictions within the dog obedience classes in Lee\u2019s Summit, Missouri. Lee\u2019s Summit had recently opened a dog park. This dog park is open to all breeds of dogs.</em></p>\n<p><em>Whitley was told that the policy referenced from the <a href=\"https://email.bestfriends.org/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://cityofls.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">cityofls.net</a>\u00a0website was implemented by the dog obedience instructor in the early 2000\u2019s. The instructor has since retired and the Parks Department has contracted with a few different providers since that time. Staff has verified with the current dog obedience contractor that specific breeds are not prohibited in obedience classes. Staff are in the process of updating brochures and other media to state that the programs prohibit aggressive dogs as opposed to specific breeds.\u00a0 </em></p>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n<p>In October, Lee's Summit, Missouri won a national award for their parks and recreation department. Their progressive\u00a0parks and recreation department runs dog obedience classes to teach dogs to be well-mannered, but they refuse to let \"pit bulls\" into the class. This is Lee's Summit's Park District Policy -- not the obedience class instructors.</p>\n<p>Any\u00a0dog that is\u00a0well trained makes a good canine citizen,\u00a0regardless of breed. The city of Lee's Summit should want\u00a0pit bulls to be\u00a0obedience trained. All dog owners, including pit bull owners, should be encouraged, not discouraged from taking their dogs to obedience classes.</p>",

The Parks Department's failure to allow dogs of every breed into the class is misguided, especially since the obedience instructor is willing to allow pit bull-type dogs into the class.\n\nCanine profiling is wrong. Dogs, like people, are individuals and should be judged as individuals. It's sound public policy to encourage, not discourage, people to train their dogs to be good canine citizens.\n\nPlease repeal the Parks Department's breed discriminatory policy. Thank you.",

    "letter_body": "In your December 2, 2010 \"Ask Amy\" column, you advised a reader to pursue a relationship with her abusive parents because she is, in your opinion, too young to do otherwise. This advice is dangerous and must be retracted. It implies both that young women don't know enough to leave abusive relationships and that abuse is somehow lessened if it comes from one's parents.\n\nThe advice-seeker \u2014 using the pseudonym \"Worried Daughter\" \u2014 describes the following situation: She grew up in a home where she suffered both emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her parents. When she was 18 years old, she got herself out of the situation. Now 20 years old, she lives on the other side of the country with her fianc\u00e9. Worried Daughter is putting herself through college with a 4.0 GPA, working full-time, paying her bills, and leading an all-around happy, productive life.\n\nWorried Daughter's problem is that her mother is trying to manipulate her once more. The mother wants her to visit, but not bring along her fianc\u00e9, whom she hates because she blames him for her daughter leaving her toxic home situation. Your advice to Worried Daughter? Try and patch things up with the mother who physically beat you and keep and eye on that supportive guy in your life.\n\nWhy is it healthy to pursue relationships with people who are emotionally and physically abusive, with people whom you say treated you like a slave and with whom continued contact is \"rare, strained and painful\"? Does you genuinely believe that this behavior is less traumatizing when it comes from a parent and not a lover?\n\nYoung women \u2014 all women, really \u2014 need to know that violence against is never their fault and that they should not stand for it. Shared DNA is not an excuse. You say that Worried Daughter is \"too young\" to make that call for herself. I disagree. There is no minimum age to know that abuse should not be tolerated.",

Single-use plastic bags are one of the major sources of plastic pollution on the planet, contributing to the declines in marine life and seabirds from  west coast to east coast of the United States and the world.\n\n Indeed, plastic bags do take their toll. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in the United States alone more than 380 billion plastic bags, sacks and wraps are used each year. Worldwide, the number of plastic bags used is anywhere from 500 billion to 1 trillion every year. Meanwhile, Americans throw away about 100 billion plastic bags each year, according to the Worldwatch Institute, as only 0.6 percent to 1 percent of them are ever recycled.\n\nNew York City needs to make a commitment to greener, healthier lifestyles for its residents and I think you are starting to move in that direction already but more can be done.  Please I  ask for your help to step up to the plate and ban the use of plastic bags in all stores throughout your beautiful city. \n\nThank you for your attention concerning this very important issue and I hope to see your effort ignite in this wave of  concern to make your city a better place for its residents.",

The Los Angeles Film School is revoking its approval of the Sunday morning street closure that makes one quarter of the market possible.</p>\n<p>The market blocks access to two of the school's parking lots, which they say they now need. But the concequences of more convienient parking could have a devestating ripple effect on the local food community. According to <a href=\"http://see-la.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEE-LA</a>, the nonprofit that runs the market, 50 farmers would lose their space and the market would <strong>lose $170,000 per year</strong> in revenue. Not just Hollywood would suffer; that money is used to keep seven other Los Angeles markets running, several of which serve <strong>low-income neighborhoods</strong> like Watts and Crenshaw. Some of these markets would have to close if the Los Angeles Film School gets its way.</p>\n<p>Parking space is always at a premium in LA, but access to fresh, local food is much more important! Councilmember Eric Garcetti represents the district, and the Los Angeles Board of Public Works is mediating this dispute. Let them know what you think before the market's temporary permit expires on January 16th!</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> The Hollywood Farmers' Market has been granted an extension for its temporary permit, and Council President Eric Garcietti has made clear his dedication to supporting the market in its current form!

    "overview": "<p>Evidence concealment, DNA switching, and a security issues are just a few of the facts uncovered in a remarkable <a href=\"http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-12-15/news/sfpd-s-troubled-crime-lab-more-evidence-of-screwups-and-coverups/\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> from <em>SF Weekly</em> released earlier this week. But, with the San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris in the midst of the scandal and rising to her newly elected position as State Attorney General this coming year, one has to wonder where the complaints should go and what can be done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In just one example laid out in their investigation, <em>SF Weekly</em> uncovers a mix-up of DNA test tubes. The evidence technician had switched two vials. Under her supervisor\u2019s approval, they traded the labels and went on with their business, leaving behind \u201cno documentation of the incident.\u201d This in the words of the lab\u2019s accreditation entity, ASCLD, a group with its own host of problems most recently tied to the North Carolina crime lab scandals. No documentation means no way for defense attorneys and even the prosecutor, in this case, to know about the mix-up and any of the cases it could have potentially impacted. Add to this the then-director of the lab, Jim Mudge, denying such a switch ever happened and you have a recipe for major questions as to the lab\u2019s integrity and potentially dozens of appeals.</p>\n<p>The DA\u2019s office seems to have been given many opportunities to share the lab\u2019s shortcomings with defense lawyers and other interested parties. In one particular report submitted to Harris\u2019 office, Rockne Harmon, a consultant for the DA\u2019s office, well known former prosecutor and so-called DNA \u201cguru\u201d himself suggested the office disclose issues with Boland\u2019s testimony to defense attorneys. And to date, even in the wake of Massulo\u2019s instruction in the Madden case, the District Attorney\u2019s office has failed to do so. Now, the office is claiming it has no such report from Harmon at all.</p>\n<p>New calls are being made to outsource the lab\u2019s work, sending it to perhaps a private lab not caught up in or tied to the SFPD or the DA\u2019s office at all. That significant of a shift could take years, however. In order for the city and the state to recognize the gravity of their problem, a complete investigation into the practices of the DNA crime lab must be completed. Join us in calling on Mayor Gavin Newsom to issue an investigation into the lab, its integrity, its evidence handling procedures, and the cases that may have been adversely affected in recent years. Neither the DA\u2019s office nor its \u201cnew trial integrity unit\u201d should play a fact finding role in the investigation because of their potential part in several of the known questionable cases at hand.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcbarnicle/4440300620/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stephen Mcg</a></em></p>",

    "letter_body": "I write this letter in response to developments that have come to light regarding the San Francisco Police Department\u2019s DNA crime lab. An in-depth report by SF Weekly has revealed numerous instances of scientific, ethical, and perhaps legal lapses within the lab and its ranks reaching to the District Attorney\u2019s office. I implore you to take action immediately and launch an independent investigation into the lab and the cases that these errors and oversights may have affected.\n\nThe integrity of a lab tasked with processing evidence from rape and homicide cases is crucial in the administration of justice. However, the integrity of the SFPD DNA lab is in jeopardy as there are reports of poor handling procedures including a DNA switch, poor security measures, improper disclosure of exculpatory evidence, and even the destruction of documents and evidence that may have brought these issues to light long before now.  From the lab personnel themselves not documenting a case where labels were switched around on crucial DNA evidence, to the DA potentially withholding evidence of questionable practices from defense attorneys, suspicion is cast on all levels within the lab and those who work in conjunction with it. \n\nWhile there aren\u2019t near as many cases affected in the practices of the DNA lab when compared with the narcotics lab, the gravity of these cases is potentially greater. The door has been opened for appeals on the grounds that this lab cannot be trusted to handle DNA evidence in a manner consistent with the constitutional application of justice.\n\nBecause the role of the District Attorney within the cases is being questioned, it is not appropriate to have that office play any role in investigating the problems within the lab. Instead, an outside audit from an unbiased and unrelated body must be completed and must be done post haste. The City of San Francisco has learned all too well what problems within a crime lab can lead to with this year\u2019s drug lab scandal. The only way to handle these new reports from the DNA lab is to deal with them immediately and with complete transparency.\n\nI appreciate your time and your prompt attention to this most urgent matter.",

Water bowls are left to freeze over, dogs suffer from frostbite, kennels are left filthy, the deadly parvovirus runs rampant and the animals apparently don't receive vet care. They've blocked out rescues and volunteers who want to help, and don't keep the facility open often enough for people to adopt or find lost pets.</p>\n<p>The Harrison County Commissioners <a href=\"http://blog/view/dogs_left_out_in_the_cold_by_harrison_county_officials\" rel=\"nofollow\">actually defended</a> the conditions at the facility, saying \"We are a dog pound, not an animal shelter.\"</p>\n<p>But as Robin McClelland, Executive Director of the Appalachian Ohio SPCA, wrote in letter to the County Commissioners calling for reform: \"One can argue the difference between a 'pound' and a 'shelter.' Regardless of the label\u00a0you choose, no one can argue that any publicly funded facility should be operated simply as a warehousing death camp for animals which fosters suffering, rather than compassion.\"</p>\n<p>(You can read the letter in its entirety <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/notes/appalachian-ohio-spca-inc/harrison-county-oh-121510-commissioner-meeting/152513448129326\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Harrison County Commissioners and dog wardens are currently facing a lawsuit and are being investigated by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation for the allegations surrounding the dog pound. Yet the commissioners stubbornly refuse to work with local rescuers or make changes to stop homeless animals from suffering in their facility.</p>\n<p>Harrison County's homeless pets deserve better. It's time to demand action and compassion. Tell the Harrison County Commissioners that you support the AOSPCA's plan for reform.</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/AppalachianOhioSCPAInc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Appalachian Ohio SPCA</a></em></p>",

    "letter_body": "I've recently become aware of the conditions at the Harrison County Dog Pound, and the willful clear violation of accepted animal cruelty laws and humane practices provided in ORC 955.15. It is unconscionable to allow your community's homeless pets to suffer this way.\n\nI support the AOSPCA's strategy for reforming the way Harrison County treats its homeless pets, and I urge you to immediately take the following actions:\n\n1.   Immediate voluntarily closure of the facility, with abandonment of the contaminated small parcel of property on which the pavilion is situated and the grounds surrounding it.  The AOSCPA will not endorse further operation of this pound, or any pound, operated by the commission until a disposition is made in the pending litigation filed by others, if we ever endorse such an operation.\n \n2.   AOSPCA and the Harrison County Humane Society, with the help of others, that have been invited to assist, such as Gentle Barn, Guardians of Rescue as well as other organizations and rescues from all over the nation, will arrange for transport for remaining dogs to those local shelters, boarding facilities and/or animal hospitals that operate in a humane manner.\n \n3.    All dogs, including strays, to be afforded the temporary shelter provided by others, at their expense on a temporary basis.  These include those dogs required to be held the mandatory 72 hours, as well as owner surrenders.  In exchange, all pull fees would to be waived.\n \n4.   Long term provisions for an adequate, humane animal shelter operated by non government, to be explored by committee of qualified animal welfare agencies, advocates, and professionals, including a member of the Ohio Dog Warden\u2019s Association, for whom the welfare of the animals is the priority, including any selection of a dog warden and/or dog pound staff to be non county operated, with the two humane organizations located in the county considering possibility of maintaining a joint \u201canimal shelter\u201d which will provide care for all animals, not just dogs (Harrison County Humane Society and the Appalachian Ohio SPCA, Inc.).\n\n5. Make it mandatory for every dog who enters the County's possession to be promptly listed on Petfinder to give them a chance at adoption.\n\nThere have been offers of help from within your community for years, and now from around the country, to implement these changes. Please do so immediately.\n\nShow your community and the world that Harrison County is compassionate and won't tolerate the suffering of companion animals.",

In the two pages dedicated to \"integrated pest management,\" including a detailed how-to on shooting cats, evidence of effectiveness and cost savings are conveniently not mentioned. Mr Vantassel and his co-authors describe a variety of inhumane means to kill cats, ranging from body-gripping taps to padded jaw foothold traps to gunshot. \n\nIronies and inconsistencies abound in the report. The authors assert that predation by cats on birds has an economic impact of more than $17 billion per year, based on the estimated cost per bird of $30 and on literature citing that bird watchers spend 40 cents per bird observed, hunters spend $216 per bird shot, and bird rearers spend $800 per bird released. For all the emphasis on economics, the study fails to even address the money a city can save in animal control costs by allowing trap, neuter and return programs instead of catching and killing. I guess they don't care about saving local communities tax dollars, just increasing business for \"pest\"managers.\n\nEven more outlandish is a 2005 University publication entitled \"The Probe: Newsletter fo rthe National Animal Damage Control Association,\" Vantassel praises Rob Erickson for using an over-the-counter product sold under the brand name \"nity-nite\" for destroying skunks. Nity-nite is in fact, acetone, also known as nail polish remover.\n\nIn these tough economic times, taxpayers shouldn't foot the bill for such frivilous and inhumane work. Please stop funding the UNL-Extension Service's wildlife program unless the Feral Cats and Their Management publication is retracted.\n\nThank you for your consideration and help in stopping the waste of resources at the University.",

In the marine environment, plastic breaks down into smaller and smaller particles that absorb toxic chemicals, are ingested by wildlife, and enter the food chain that we depend on.  Consumption of throwaway plastics, such as bottles, containers, bags, and packaging, has spiraled out of control.   Recycling is not a sustainable solution.  Most of our plastic waste is landfilled or exported to other countries. And tragically, millions of tons of plastic poison our ocean, rivers and lakes. Businesses and governments must take responsibility for new ways to design, recover and dispose of plastics.  Plastic pollution is the visible symbol of our global crisis of over-consumption. Let's pledge to shift our societies away from the disposable habits that poison our waters and land, eliminate our consumption of throwaway plastics, and begin embracing a culture of sustainability.

    "letter_body": "I would like to thank all  the Council Members who made possible the introduction of Intro 670, the bill that amends the Administrative Code - Section 17-239 Disposition of Licensed Horse.  \n\nThe present law is deeply flawed and allows horses who are sold outside NYC to fall between the cracks.  When the horses leave the system, there is no accountability required. Sale and transfer records are only required to be submitted to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene when the transaction is made within NYC, but no records are required if the sale is made outside of the city as most are.  \n\nI ask City Council members to sponsor and pass this bill, which requires that the owner sell or donate the horse to either private individuals or a duly incorporated animal sanctuary, with a signed assurance that the horse will not be sold and shall be kept solely as a companion animal and not employed in another horse-drawn carriage business or as a work horse and that the horse would not be sold to auctions or slaughter.  \n\nThese horses have it hard enough working in heavy, congested traffic for nine hours a day, seven days a week, only to come back to a stall that is small by expert standards with no turnout to pasture for 47 weeks a year.  Please pity them in their last years.  \n\nWe know that some horses were found at slaughter auctions \u2013 Bobby II Freedom, who was rescued in 2010 and is now living at Equine Advocates in Chatham, NY.  Lilly O\u2019Reilly who is honored on our web site.  She was rescued in 2006.  And Manhattan, a horse found at the kill auctions by a rescue group a few years ago.  These horses were found but how many others are not so lucky.   \n\nPlease let NYC not be known as the city that supplies its horses to slaughter auctions.  Take a stand for the welfare of these horses.  \n\nThe language of this proposal was part of Intro 658A and 86A, the bill that would phase out the carriage industry and replace it with vintage replica electric cars.  \n\nI ask the Council to pity the poor horses and at least save them from the kill auctions now.  \n\nThank you.",

With present mechanisms, structures and progresses, it would take many more decades just to obtain a comprehensive global plan of requirements and actions. The necessities and urgency to solve global problems, in particularly environment, global warming and climate change cannot be effectively, efficiently and properly implemented or solved in parts. They must be solved in whole and if possible, simultaneously and in coordination.<br><br>To effectively protect and revive the environment, adapt and mitigate global warming and climate change, a comprehensive global plan and actions must be devised and implemented. There are presently several proposals from the global communities regarding creating a Convention on Environment Protection and Rights (such as Earth Rights and Convention on Environment Protection Rights). This convention should be the comprehensive or main environment sustainable and development plan. Development such as Kyoto Protocol, Climate Panel, Climate Change Forum, Biodiversity Forum, and Land and Soil Forum should be parts or sub-sets of the Environment Protection and Rights Convention. Addition panels or forums should also be created in parallel or simultaneously such as Environment Protection Panel, Aquaculture Forum, Agriculture Forum, Wastes and Recycle Forum and Renewable and Clean Energy Forum. In other words, it is necessary and urgent to implement solutions simultaneously or in parallel and as a whole, from top down approach as well as bottom up approach and in interdependent-interconnect ways to obtain best ideas and solutions, prevent overlaps and oversights, coordinate and utilize all possible available resources comprehensively, maximize efficiency and productivity, minimize costs and time duration, maximize effectiveness and results, involve and inspire the whole global community, and for activities or projects to\u00a0 complement each other and to strengthen and re-enforce their successes and results. Therefore, for the global community to effective adapt and mitigate environment and biodiversity problems, global warming and climate change adaptation and mitigation, it is necessary to: <br><br>* Empower, inspire, involve and collaborate with the world poor, vulnerable, outcast and indigenous communities to effectively solve global issues or make these communities parts of solutions. There are much knowledge, experience and human resources to help solve problems and advance the common good. This approach would certainly advance other global efforts such as universal human rights and environment protection and rights.<br><br>* The Millennium Goals cannot be effective or achievable without people and communities empowerment and wealthy, healthy and safe environment. Therefore, not only universal human rights be made part of the efforts, but also environment protection and rights must also be integrated in the over all plan. This way, the achievement or advancement in each category would strengthen, support and advance other efforts or categories.<br><br>* Implement, monitor and enforce of all UN Conventions and Treaties across the global communities. The efforts can be advanced by connecting and integrating conventions and treaties with Millennium Goals, Universal Human Rights, Environment Protection and Rights and Climate Change projects through an interdependent-interconnect-interrelate matrix which would strengthen, complement and support each others. Progresses, advancements or achievements in one or more would advance or strengthen others.<br><br>Many global crises cannot be eliminated or effectively solved with present global plans, actions and progresses. If further efforts and actions are not taken, then crises or problems would further aggravated which would cause much sufferings, destructions and losses for generations. Global mind, consciousness and awareness must be raised , elevated, encouraged and inspired for new ways of thinking, bold or ambitious actions, empathy, goodwill, collective social and environment responsibility and the common good. The severed\u00a0 deterioration and potential\u00a0 dangers of the planet life supporting eco-systems and global communities require whole plans with true or proper solutions and collective efforts to urgently solve or correct problems at the root causes or sources; and inclusive and collective global accountability and social responsibility to carry out the implementation and efforts.

Environment  and Forest Minister Jairam Ramesh is on record saying that TATA\u2019s Dhamra  port in Orissa<strong> </strong>would have been stopped on account of a legal violation, had its construction not started already [1].<br> <br> In the file noting obtained <strong>under RTI</strong>,  Ramesh says, \u201cHad construction not commenced, we could have taken a  decision unequivocally not to let the project proceed at the site whose  \u201cforest\u201d status is disputed.\u201d Located close to the Gahirmatha and  Bitharkanika Protected Areas, the Dhamra port project poses a threat to  the environment and endangered species like the <strong>Olive Ridley Sea turtles</strong> and saltwater crocodiles.</a><br> <br> The port could have been stopped for violating the law; the <strong>fragile ecology</strong> of the area could have been saved. So why were the <strong>TATAs let off</strong> so easily? Influence? Money power? Is there more to this than meets the eye?<br> <br> <strong>So, why do you think TATA\u2019s forest land violation was overlooked?</strong><br> <br> <a href=\"http://links.mailing.greenpeace.org/ctt?kn=5&amp;m=36089131&amp;r=NTIxNjA1OTY0MAS2&amp;b=0&amp;j=ODk4MDE2NzcS1&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/What-We-Do/Defending-our-oceans/Coastal-development/Why-was-Tata-let-off-the-hook1/</a><br> <br> This information vindicates lakhs of Indians who have <strong>opposed the port</strong> for the last several years [2]. It reveals that powerful corporations  are allowed to get away with blatant legal violations. It also shows  that, in this case at least, the TATA group has not upheld the high  standards of <strong>ethics</strong> that they claim to have.<br> <br> Based on letters issued by the ministry\u2019s own officials, a case was  filed last year against the violation of the Forest Conservation Act,  1980 [3]. Despite high ranking officers confirming the violation, the  central ministry gave a clean chit to the port [4].<br> <br> To make matters worse, TATA is now proposing a further <strong>expansion of the port</strong>, and other industries are proposed for the area. This eco-sensitive area could have been saved, had the ministry <strong>taken action</strong> in time.

    "letter_body": "In a major blow to the government\u2019s move on mega cement plants, the Himachal Pradesh High Court on Monday 13-12-2010 quashed environmental clearance granted to a cement plant near Sundernagar in Mandi district. It also set aside the land acquisition proceedings under way at the site, which was approved by the then government in 2005. Local farmers were opposing the land acquisitions.\n\nHarish Cement India, a unit of Grasim Cements, was first approved in 1995 by the Congress government, but it could not come up. After returning to power, the Congress save approval to it again in 2005 despite strong opposition from environmental groups, including Chipko Movement leader Sunderlal Bahuguna and locals, as the plant was barely 5.65 kilometres away from the Bandli wildlife sanctuary.\n\nThe orders were passed on 13-12-2010 by the High Court\u2019s Green Bench, which disposed of six separate petitions filed by the affected locals, who had raised serious environmental concerns and also questioned the manner in which the government cleared the plant close to a wildlife sanctuary. The mandatory provision under the Environment Protection Act 1986 to hold an open public hearing before granting approvals was allegedly not followed. \nIn its 91-page judgment, the bench comprising Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice Rajeev Sharma questioned how environmental clearances were granted completely on external considerations, instead of forming an independent view on the basis of ground realities. The judges also took note of the location of a wildlife sanctuary nearby, which was totally overlooked. \nThe decision comes close on the heels of an earlier order of the Environmental Appellate Authority, quashing clearances granted to the Rs 900-crore Lafarge cement plant, proposed in Karsog area of the same district. Renuka Dam, a multi-purpose project (Rs 3,300 cr) in Sirmour district and 800-MW Kol Dam hydel project of the National Thermal Power Corporation, too, have been put on hold by the environment ministry because of the ecological issues involved.\n\nThe Himachal government has sanctioned at least four cement plants in the last five years.\n\nIn this case of Sundernagar, the petitioners had approached the court in 2009 after the state government refused to review its decision and did not accept demand for a public hearing.\n\n\u201cWe had tried to bring to the court\u2019s notice the fact that provisions of the Environment Protection Act were not followed. No public hearing was organised and the locals never got an opportunity to present their views,\u201d said petitioner and Naresh Kadyan,  representative of the International Organisation for Animal Protection - OIPA in India welcome the decision.\n\nIf the reports on powerful corporates influencing Cabinet formation were not incriminating enough, there is another shocker. The Minister of Environment Jairam Ramesh condoned Tata Steel and L&amp;T\u2019s violation of the Forest Conservation Act 1980 in their joint Dhamra port project in Orissa.\n\nThis shocking revelation of corporates influencing government decisions emerged from file notings recently obtained by Greenpeace through an RTI application. It is in sharp contradiction to the Ministry\u2019s own strictures against Vedanta, Adarsh Society and the Lavasa township.\n\nThe file noting by Jairam Ramesh (1) admits that there is a probable legal violation, but argues in favour of condoning it on the grounds that \u201cthe port itself is nearing completion. Had construction not commenced, we could have taken a decision unequivocally not to let the project proceed at the site whose \u201cforest status\u201d is disputed.\u201d\n\nWhy was the Tata-led company let off when there is sufficient evidence of a violation? The nation deserves an answer to what extent the TATAs can influence government decisions, and begs the question whether there are different rules for different violators.\n\n\u201cThis is another shocking example of the government ignoring legal transgressions by big business houses,\u201d  \n\u201cIn the light of this discovery, and the scams unearthed in recent weeks, we wonder if this country is being ruled by giant corporations and the motive of profit at all costs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nation also needs to know, especially in the light of reports that corporate lobbyists robbed the nation to the tune of Rs 1.76 lakh crore in the 2G spectrum allocation, what factors contributed in the Dhamra projects getting a go ahead instead of being penalized.\n\nThe fait accompli logic used by the Ministry sets a dangerous precedent, and contradicts the government\u2019s statements on the Adarsh Society project in Mumbai, or Vedanta\u2019s Lanjigarh refinery \u2013 both of which the MoEF has threatened to demolish/shut down for violating the law.\n\nThe note goes on to say that \u201c\u2026were we to consider this case today, we will have no option but to insist on clearance under FCA 1980\u201d, before then instructing that an affidavit be filed before the Supreme Court\u2019s Central Empowered Committee taking the position that the area is not forest land. This was preceded by a hand-written submission from B. Muthuraman, Vice Chairman of TATA Steel, to Mr. Ramesh, pleading TATA Steel\u2019s case and asserting the TATA group\u2019s adherence to its \u2018principles\u2019 (2).\n\nIn a public exposure of big corporations getting off the hook, Greenpeace issued an advertisement in leading papers today, raising concerns on the double standards of the government towards corporations (3).\n\nThe Dhamra port in Orissa has been the centre of controversy for years on account of its location adjacent to the Bhitarkanika National Park and Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary. Evidence of violation of the Forest Conservation Act first became public in 2009. With no action taken by the MoEF, the first phase of the port is now nearing completion, and plans are underway for a massive Phase II expansion into more dangerous cargo such as oil and naptha.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s file noting is silent on the Phase II expansion of the port and the additional industries proposed in the area. Ironically, earlier in the year, the ministry had rejected clearance for a proposed power plant near Dhamra, on account of the area\u2019s ecological significance.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of message is going out to corporate India and the country at large, if all that is needed to get an illegal project regularized is to present the government with a fait accompli?\u201d  \n\nWe demands punitive measures against the project and a permanent freeze on all planned industrial activity (including further port expansion) within the buffer zone of Bhitarkanika and Gahirmatha. With over 300 ports planned across the coast of mainland India, We are also asking for stricter measures to protect ecologically critical coastal areas from short-sighted and poorly planned port development.",

    "overview": "<p>\n</p><p>Indiana is on the brink of making some major progressive changes to their criminal sentencing practices. Governor Mitch Daniels <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/daniels-endorses-findings-of-criminal-code-review/PARAMS/article/24023\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced </a>his support on Wednesday for sweeping changes that could ultimately save over a billion dollars in the next seven years. Not just fiscally responsible, these changes would also serve to halt the progression of the incarceration monster, a beast that caused Indiana\u2019s inmate population to skyrocket 41% from 2000 to 2008.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.justicereinvestment.org/states/indiana\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> commissioned by the state, the Pew Center on the States and the Council of State Governments Justice Center revealed that Indiana had the fastest growing prison population in the nation. And of these, more than 55% of new incarcerations were for drug offenses and nonviolent thefts.</p>\n<p>These two organizations made a series of recommendations to stop the prison growth and save the state an estimated $1.2 Billion between now and 2017. Though all of these recommendations haven\u2019t been released to the public yet, the Governor is pushing lawmakers to get busy on drafting legislation to make them a reality. Some sources say legislators have already begun preparing such prison-reform bills they hope to pass in this upcoming session.</p>\n<p>\n</p><p>Sentencing reform holds crucial benefits not only to the state\u2019s budget but also to public safety. By reserving prison for the most violent and highest risk offenders, the public can rest assured that their money is being spent to incarcerate those who truly pose a risk to their communities. Under current laws, judges have little to no discretion in who gets locked up\u2014sending low risk drug offenders to the same fate as those convicted of violent crimes.</p>\n<p>Governor Mitch Daniels and Indiana lawmakers in both parties stand poised to make changes to the current system. While legislation hasn\u2019t been drafted yet, it\u2019s important that an issue with this much seeming support not be allowed to fade as weeks pass. Show Indiana lawmakers you support efforts to cut costs and decrease the further over-incarceration of the Hoosier State.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Credit: </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/editor/335310324/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Bart Everson</em>\u00a0</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

The findings of this report are not likely news to you. The proposed changes, as you already know, have been endorsed by the Governor and many of your legislative counterparts.\n\nI write this letter in show of support for changes within the Indiana criminal courts and ask that progress continue to be made on making the Pew Center recommendations a reality. In particular, judges should have greater discretion in sentencing non violent offenders to community correction supervision. The state\u2019s probation system must be strengthened to provide the resources needed to keep offenders out of prison and as productive members of their communities instead.\n\nCurrently, Indiana has the fastest growing prison population. Left as is, the growth alone could cost the state more than an additional $1 Billion between now and 2017. Changes to current practices could curtail these astronomical costs and the cost to citizens who would be better served by treatment options within the community.\n\nPlease make every effort to see that Indiana reform their incarceration practices by drafting and enacting legislation to encourage community corrections above imprisonment for non violent offenders. \n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.",

    "letter_body": "I wish to respectfully request the Senate to change the rule(s) for the filibuster on January 26th, 2011, or this Senate rule may not be changed again until the first day of the next Senate (two years from now).  The new rules must require a Senator that opposes legislation to stand before the Senate and plead his case to the American people.  Eliminate reading the phone book or other unrelated material and require the arguments pertain only to the legislation being opposed.  Retain the rights of the minority in the Senate, however, require 'a cost' to the Senator that wishes to filibuster.  Additionally, ensure that a minimum of one half of the Senators on the opposing side remain on the Senate floor during all debates for a filibuster.  \n\nThe U.S. Senate is broken.  A single Senator can delay a bill from even being considered by simply making a phone call to a clerk and then going home.  Senator Merkley (D-Ore.) stated, \u201cWe should require a number of Senators to remain on the floor in order to filibuster.  Senators should make their case before the American people and explain why the majority is making such a colossal mistake that we should suspend normal democratic decision-making.\u201d\n\nDespite controlling only 42 seats in the Senate for the past two years, Republicans have been able to either delay or completely block several Democratic bills by filibustering them, and this preventing the majority from attaining the 60 votes needed to get the bills passed.  One senator may stop 99 other Senators from doing essential work for the American people, remain anonymous and avoid the pain of explaining his objections to the Senate or the American people.  The abuse of the filibuster MUST END!",

    "letter_body": "I recently read on Change.org that Hi-Q Egg Farm is planning to construct one of the largest egg laying facilities in the nation in York Township, Ohio. I am writing to ask you to ensure that this does not occur. \n\nHi-Q has been attempting to build its farm for three years. The plan has met much resistance from the residents of Ohio. The farm would produce an estimated 74,000 tons of chicken manure, creating public health and environmental dangers. \n\nThis is also a national issue, as Hi-Q's eggs would be eaten all over the United States. Eggs gathered from factory farming facilities such as the one Hi-Q proposes are more likely to be contaminated by salmonella. \n\nAllowing this farm to be built would be a step backwards for animal welfare. Chickens kept in battery cages cannot even spread their wings. They are kept crammed in with other birds, and often suffer from untreated wounds and broken legs or wings. Dead birds have been found rotting in cages alongside live hens. \n\nEarlier this year, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland made an agreement with the Humane Society of the United States not to allow farms with small cages to be built after Dec. 31st. I urge the new Ohio administration to uphold this promise. \n\nI am hopeful that both Ohio's new governor and new Director of Agriculture will make the right choice for Ohio residents, American egg consumers, and the welfare of chickens. Please deny the necessary permits for Hi-Q to built their factory farm. \n\nThank you.",

As part of his \u201cHealthy and  Sustainable Food for San Francisco\" Executive Directive, which was  issued back in 2009, Mayor Newsom recently proposed a code amendment  that would define urban agriculture and allow urban farmers to operate in commercial, residential, industrial, and mix-use districts.</p>\n<p>Mayor Newsom proposed this initiative, but now its up to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to pass and approve this amendment.

The Agency will  need unprecedented public pressure to make  use of its emergency powers.  And you can bet Bayer will batle to  keep this blockbuster product on  the market. But <em>we have to pick this  fight. </em>Here's why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>U.S. bee populations are still declining</strong> and scientists   believe pesticides are a critical piece of the puzzle. Clothianidin\u2019s   family of pesticides (neonicotinoids, including imidacloprid) are an   especially suspect culprit.</li>\n<li><strong>Clothianidin is on the U.S. market on the basis of unsound science</strong> and deeply flawed EPA decision-making.

We are writing to request that you take urgent action to stop the use of this toxic chemical. As we are sure you appreciate, the failure of the agency to provide adequate protection for pollinators creates an emergency with imminent hazards: Food production, public health and the environment are all seriously threatened, and the collapse of the commercial honeybee-keeping industry would result in economic harm of the highest magnitude for U.S. agriculture.\n\nThe science shows that clothianidin-contaminated pollen and nectar presents an imminent hazard. Because the hazards to honeybee health are present within registered use parameters, it is clear that label changes and use restrictions will not offer adequate protection. We therefore urge the agency to issue a stop use order immediately. Our nation cannot afford, and the environment cannot tolerate another growing season of clothianindin use.\n\nIn addition, because this problem reflects an overuse of the conditional registration program, we urge you to set an immediate moratorium on the use of such registrations until the program is fully evaluated for compliance with its underlying statutory responsibilities. The conditional registration of clothianidin in 2003 with outstanding data critical to its safety assessment represents a failure that could and should have been avoided.\n\nThank you for your attention to this urgent matter,",

    "overview": "<p>On Saturday, February 19th, the House of Representatives approved a Continuing Resolution (CR), H.R. 1 that<strong> cut $1.3 billion from the Health Centers Program and</strong> <strong>represents real and significant threat to keeping health center funding whole. </strong>These cuts<strong> </strong>threaten  the 127 new ARRA funded health centers and jeopardize access to care to  the 3.3 million new patients. The proposed bill would\u00a0also halt the  expansion of the cost-effective health center model for FY2011, meaning  no funding for New Access Points, Expanded Services applications that  have already been submitted would go unfunded, and communities seeking  planning grants for health centers would not be awarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Be aware that the House passage of the CR is  the first step in the process. The Senate and White House will have  significant involvement in this process and for the House bill to become  law, both chambers (House AND Senate) will ultimately need to pass <em>the same bill</em>.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While we can\u2019t be sure how things will unfold over the next few weeks, <strong>we  do know that NOW is the time to educate Senators and their staff about  what these cuts would mean to your health center and community and to </strong><strong>continue to advocate for level discretionary funding of $2.19 billion in FY2011.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>What will cuts to Health Centers mean:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The devastating $1.3 billion cut in H.R. 1 will mean      that overall health centers will lose the capacity to serve <strong>11 million</strong> patients in FY2011 alone.\u00a0      \n<ul>\n<li>Within months, 127 new health centers that have opened       in the  last year and a half thanks to Recovery Act or stimulus funds will        have to <strong>CLOSE THEIR DOORS.</strong> </li>\n<li>Well over 3.7 million patients who have received       access to  care in the last year and a half under the Recovery Act or        stimulus New Access Point and Increased Demand for Services funding will  <strong>LOSE       ACCESS</strong> to care within months as a result of this cut.</li>\n<li>This cut will not only halt the expansion of the        cost-effective, high-quality and patient-directed health center model of        care, it will have real, devastating and virtually immediate  impacts on       existing health centers and the communities and  patients they serve \u2013       pregnant women, children, those without  health insurance due to the       recession and recent unemployment and  people with HIV/AIDS to name a few       \u2013 will literally be left with  nowhere to turn.</li>\n<li>Health centers will also be forced to lay off over       10,000  employees in the rural and urban underserved communities where        they are located.</li>\n<li>This proposed cut comes at a time when states have to       cut $89  million in financial support to health centers due to their        budgetary crises.<br><br><em><strong>Keeping health centers funding whole will:</strong></em><br><em><strong>\u00a0</strong></em></li>\n<li>Ensure that health center funding\u00a0 accounts for the growth the  program experienced in the past 18 months by adding 3.7 million  patients, 127 new centers, and 10,000 new jobs;</li>\n<li>Allow HRSA to make awards for the new access point (NAP),  expanded services (ES), and planning grant funding opportunities the  agency previously announced; and</li>\n<li>Extend the cost-effective, high-quality and patient-directed  model of care to patients who currently lack a routine source of primary  care and would otherwise seek care in emergency departments or delay  care until hospitalization is the only option.</li>\n<li>Decades of research have shown that health centers RETURN money  to the health care system, including the nation\u2019s entitlement programs.  Investing in health centers increases that return on investment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

    "letter_body": "I am contacting you today to urge that you OPPOSE cuts to the Health Centers Program and do everything you can to make sure the Program is level-funded in FY2011. \n\nI understand that both the House and Senate are working to negotiate and pass a final funding bill for FY11. As you consider this funding bill please make sure that there are NO CUTS to Health Center funding. Any cut to the Health Centers Program will have an immediate and devastating impact on my health center, our patients, and our community. \n\nIt is critical that the Health Centers program\u2019s discretionary funding remain whole in order for our local health center to continue providing access to cost-effective and  high-quality care to those most in need. When patients go without access to cost-effective primary and preventive care through a health center, they instead seek care in high-cost settings like hospital emergency rooms or face unnecessary hospitalizations. Health centers have proven over their history that they save the health system money: on average $1200 per patient per year. Investing in health centers makes good fiscal sense and for that reason, support for the Health Centers program has been bipartisan over its long history.  \n\nI am counting on your support. Please vocally OPPOSE any cuts to Health Center funding and make sure that the Health Centers program discretionary is funding is kept at $2.19 billion in FY2011.\n\nThank You.",

A study published in September found that the technique is more damaging to nature than all other human activities combined.</p>\n<p>The culprit, again, is the appetite of a growing human population. Over the past 50 years, the withdrawal of these animals in the oceans has increased more than fourfold.

China, the biggest consumer of the planet, for example, cut its seas of 9.9 million tonnes of fish annually, but consumes 13.6 million tons. Called in the open sea, where there are no laws regulating the activity of fishing has increased almost tenfold from the 1950s. The jump was 1.6 million tons to 13 million tonnes.</p>\n<p>The removal of species from the top of the food chain is the biggest damage to ecosystems. SeafoodPrint The study, released today, says that fishing for a kilo of tuna has an impact 100 times greater than that of a kilo of sardines. The justification of the researchers is that, every day, a specimen of the predator to eat their own body weight in lesser beings to stay alive. A tuna of 450 pounds eats smaller fish up to 15 thousand per year. Soon, the death of such an animal means a much greater loss than it may seem.</p>\n<p>\u00a0European decision further endanger marine ecosystems!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Tell the EU to revise its policies and not endanger marine life!</p>",

Experts estimate that a few weeks of this practice are sufficient to destroy the ecosystems that took thousands of years to form.\n\n\"To capture one or two commercial species, the trawl boats pulling large nets armed with metal plates and heavy rollers by the seabed, turning the soil and spraying everything in its path,\" says a report of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, an alliance of more of 70 scientific and conservation groups fighting for quotas for fishing on the planet. A study published in September found that the technique is more damaging to nature than all other human activities combined.\n\nThe culprit, again, is the appetite of a growing human population. Over the past 50 years, the withdrawal of these animals in the oceans has increased more than fourfold. The technological improvement of fishing fleets and the exploration of areas previously preserved were crucial to more than 77.9 million tons of fish and seafood started to be extracted from the seas every year.\n\nThe increased consumption of large predators such as tuna and salmon made the country ceased to restrict fishing to their exclusive economic zones stretch of water that stretches for 370 km up the coast. China, the biggest consumer of the planet, for example, cut its seas of 9.9 million tonnes of fish annually, but consumes 13.6 million tons. Called in the open sea, where there are no laws regulating the activity of fishing has increased almost tenfold from the 1950s. The jump was 1.6 million tons to 13 million tonnes.\n\nThe removal of species from the top of the food chain is the biggest damage to ecosystems. SeafoodPrint The study, released today, says that fishing for a kilo of tuna has an impact 100 times greater than that of a kilo of sardines. The justification of the researchers is that, every day, a specimen of the predator to eat their own body weight in lesser beings to stay alive. A tuna of 450 pounds eats smaller fish up to 15 thousand per year. Soon, the death of such an animal means a much greater loss than it may seem.\n\nEuropean decision further endanger marine ecosystems!\n\nRevise its policies and not endanger marine life!\n\nYou should be ashamed of such facts. How can a blind eye to such atrocities. What world do you want to leave your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren?\n\nTo do such is to have no respect for animals and humans. It's not caring about life and everything is so irresponsible and unable to hold positions of importance!\n\nI sincerely hope you go back and review this decision. To err is human, it is natural, but it is necessary to have humility and recognize that went wrong and fix the error.\n\nSincerely,",

If only your coalition got together and decided to eradicate hunger or a disease or do something that really makes the world better. \n\nYou are correct about one thing though \u2013 I am not interested in debating with you, because the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual &amp; transgender people is not something that you get to debate. I don\u2019t feel I have the right to debate your ability to worship, your right to marry the person you love, your right to not get fired or killed simply because of who you love or your right to serve our great nation because of who you are. So why do you think that you should get to debate those rights for LGBT Americans? \n\nWe have had enough debate. We have endured the embarrassment of watching our fellow citizens vote on whether we deserve the same rights as everyone else, we have watched commercials that portray us as monsters who are trying to corrupt your children, and we periodically tune into C-SPAN to see our country\u2019s leaders use our lives as fodder for political maneuvering. Forgive me if I am not eager to get into a debate on whether I am deserving of equality. \n\nThe sad part is that you truly do not seem to understand the dire consequences of your leadership.  \n\nRight now, thousands of young gay people are excited for the Christmas break, because it means a respite from the anti-gay bullying they face each day, yet you continue to fight anti-bullying efforts and your answer to those being harassed is that the harassment will stop when you begin denying who you are. \n\nRight now, gay parents are working to create a special Christmas for their children, and the Family Research Council is dedicating resources to make it more difficult for children to be adopted into gay households. \n\nPeople who want to be able to fight for their country and live an open and honest life at the same time are forced to hide who they are, in part because you dedicate such a significant portion of your operating budget to counter \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal efforts.\n\nThe bottom line is that your measurement of success coincides with my measurement of inequality and when my rights are obstructed, your organization celebrates.  \n\nHow sad for you.

    "letter_body": "So I Ryan Lee Bailey came down from Portland Oregon to Klamath Falls Oregon to visit my father. I came out to him and so I and him got into a fight. I was stabed and fought him off and the police were called. My father did not want to place charges on me, but the local policce force however did. I ended up going to jail and being put on 36months of probation and my father was not charged.\n\nMy probation officer Daryl Cooper was asking things of me that is illegal. He was telling me that he would have me thrown in prison if I did not stop acting gay and being gay and that I could not be Pagan, I had to be either Christian or Atheist. I had made a fake girlfriend Lizzy Jackson to show to him so that I would not be placed in prison, but he seen through it. He told me that since the probation offices of Klamath County did not draw federal funding that they could persecute homosexuals per Oregon law. I finaly talked him into letting me move back to Portland Oregon or so I thought. He wrote and signed his name to a probation orders form that I was to move to Washington County Oregon and remain there until my county transfer went through. However when I walked out the door he put a warrent out for my arrest.\n\nWhile in Washington County Oregon I thought that everything was going good for me finaly. I ended up one night being pulled over while driving for speeding. The officer asked me to step out of the vehicle which I complied. I didn't even get stood up all the way and he tased me and I passed out where then he beat me while I was still passed out. I woke up in the hospital choking on my own blood and beaten so badly that I could not see and was druged by the medics there. I was thrashing about and screaming not knowing where I was or why I was in so much pain and could not see. They put me under and next I woke in jail. They told me that I was being charged with absconding, DUII even though I hadn't been drinking, and attempted murder for spitting blood in the officers face at the hospital. I was tested for HIV and was negative and so they lowered the attepted murder to an assualt 3.\n\nDurring court my lawyer had obtained the police discovery for when I was arrested. It showed that he tased me and then beat me severely with me being passed out. He had kicked me in the head many times with me just laying there. I and my lawyer were not allowed to present any evidence and I was not allowed to even speak in court. I was sentenced to 13 months in prison.\n\nI was put through mental health treatment while in prison and was diagnosed with every mental illness under the Sun so that they could invalidate any thing I had to say. Before being released I was sent to the Klamath County Work Release Center where I was constantly being threatened by other inmates. I was being beaten and harrassed quite often. I was constantly informing the counselors of what was being done to me there and they allways tried to convince me that it was in my head. I ended up being sexualy assulted and then they sent me back to prison. The Klamath County Work Release Center tried to just sweep it under the carpet, but I mailed the Dome Building of what happened in a TORT form, yet never received a reply. I was released Oct 22nd 2010.\n\nSince getting out of prison I have been put in Anger Management treatment, Mental Health Treatment, Domestic Violence Treatment, and Alcoholism Treatment. My probation officer Ida Lamons has multiple times told me that I have to not be in a gay relationship, not act gay, and not be gay or she will put me in prison for 26months which I am sure she will do. The Klamath County Courthouse is having me constantly go to court saying that my absconding was never resolved and that they want me to do the 26 months in prison, but I know they just want me to be heterosexual and Christian.My next court date is Dec 28th 2010.\n\nI have a boyfriend here in Klamath Falls Oregon now. His name is Harold Tim Clark. A few days ago I outed him to some of his friends and he didn't take it too well and tried killing himself. It became out of my hands and I called the police for help. They took him to the hospital, but the problem is that they arrested his too. 11 years ago when he was in the Air Force he was being charged with a sex crime. It was taken care of and dismissed. After 7 years in Oregon crimes vanish even if it was murder. Since 11 years ago when the crime was dismissed he has had many background checks from working at NEW who does not hire felons, has had 3 exchange students live with him, and got a DUII last year. The courts and police have never brought up the sex crime from 11 years ago until a few days ago when they arrested him. Now he is facing something like 40 years in prison for not registering as a sex offender, and being in possession of fire arms. This can not be anything other than prejudice, persecution, and discrimination.\n\nYesterday I was forced to put a restraining order on my father for comming into my house and making contact with me. I have a no contact with him. I don't want the no contact nor the restraining order and niether does my father. I had to place it on him to prevent myself from going to prison for 26 months. My fathers name is Durward Laurance Bailey and if you would like to ask him about it his phone number is 541-882-8965 and he too lives here in Klamath Falls Oregon.\n\nI am facing 26 months in prison and my boyfriend is facing 40 years in prison due to this witch hunt by a very prejudice and corrupt law system. If any one knows what I can do to resolve this I would be greatly indebted. Thank you for hearing my story...\n\nI am Ryan Lee Bailey and my e-mail address is <a href=\"mailto:BlackSouth36@yahoo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">BlackSouth36@yahoo.com</a>",

Although vertical fracking has been in use for over 40 years, Horizontal fracking is newer, very different, and much more dangerous.  In other states, incidents have been documented in which horizontal fracking posed grave threats to people\u2019s health, safety and environment, especially via toxins and natural gas being leaked into their aquifers, wells, lakes and streams and into the air.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2005, fracking was exempted from the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act by the \u201cHalliburton Loophole.\u201d  This also weakened EPA functions within states, making our safety and rights more dependent on state regulatory laws and agencies.  Indeed, given this situation, New York State and New Jersey are not allowing any horizontal fracking in the Marcellus Shale until new, more stringent regulations are in place.  And Pittsburgh has banned horizontal fracking from its city limits.\n\nThese issues need to be addressed: Landowners should not be pressured to sign leases without specific information about the impact of drilling on their use of their land.  They should have the right not to be forced to lease their land for gas production under pooling or \u201cunitization.\u201d  Officials of townships, villages and cities should receive applications before permits are granted, prior to drilling; local governments should be able to assess and agree upon site positioning, traffic and road usage, water resources and treatment of waste deposits, emergency plans in the event of accidents, and impact on infrastructure and existing patterns of land usage.  Chemicals used in drilling should be non-toxic or at the very least non-carcinogenic, and seismic analysis should be required to prevent seepage of gas and radioactive fluids to the surface.\n\nThus we appeal to your concern for the safety of Ohio citizens, and we believe such a decision, even without our initiative, would be justifiable based on the experiences and actions of our neighboring states.  How noble it would be for one of your last acts as Governor to side with citizens, townships, counties, and cities that seek fairness and safety against the superior resources and lobbying power of the profit-driven Oil and Gas Industry.",

    "letter_body": "As the 111th session of Congress comes to a close, we would like to thank you for your support of the Uniting American Families Act (UAFA; H.R.1024; S.424). \n\nAs you know, under current U.S. immigration law, gay and lesbian Americans in committed relationships with foreign partners are denied the right to sponsor their partners for a green card. This terrible oversight that has led to thousands of heartbreaking cases of gratuitous cruelty in forcing same-sex binational couples apart could be fixed with the passage of UAFA. UAFA would add three simple words to existing U.S. immigration law \u201cor permanent partners\u201d wherever the word \u201cspouse\u201d appears. It would then give the same rights and responsibilities to same-sex binational couples that opposite-sex binational couples can currently obtain. \n\nWe urge you, our supporters, to do what you can in the lame duck session of Congress to either move UAFA forward as a standalone bill, or ensure that it remains included in any version of Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR). Our families are grateful to you for your support to date, and are depending on your support now and in the future. \n\nWhether you are returning to Congress in its 112th session next year or leaving at the close of this \nsession, we hope that you will continue to support equal rights for LGBT Americans and continue to \nchampion the end of immigration discrimination against same-sex binational couples. \n\nSincerely, \n\nThe members and supporters of Out4Immigration",

The  Vegetarian Society defines a vegetarian as: \"Someone who lives on a diet  of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits with, or without,  the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat,  poultry, game, fish, shellfish* or by-products of slaughter.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Shellfish are typically \u2018a sea animal covered with a shell\u2019. We take shellfish to mean;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crustaceans (hard external shell) Large \u2013 e.g. lobsters, crayfish, crabs, small \u2013 e.g. prawns, shrimps\u00a0 <br><br></li>\n<li>Molluscs  (most are protected by a shell) E.g. mussels, oysters, winkles,  limpets, clams, etc. Also includes cephalopods such as cuttlefish,  squid, octopus. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are different types of vegetarian:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lacto-ovo-vegetarians eat both dairy products and eggs; this is the most common type of vegetarian diet. <br><br></li>\n<li>Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy products but avoid eggs. <br><br></li>\n<li>Vegans do not eat dairy products, eggs, or any other products which are derived from animals. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eggs:</strong> Many lacto-ovo vegetarians will only eat free-range eggs. This is  because of welfare objections to the intensive farming of hens. Through  its Vegetarian Society Approved trade mark, the Vegetarian Society only  endorses products containing free-range eggs.</p>\n<p>Some people may be  vegetarian for religious reasons. Jains, for example, are either  lacto-vegetarian or vegan, while some Hindus and Buddhists may chose to  practice a vegetarian diet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Compassion for animals is one of the main reasons why people become vegetarian.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In  the UK alone, over two million land animals and almost\u00a0600,000 tonnes  of fish\u00a0are slaughtered each year, just so that people can eat their  flesh or wear their skin.</p>\n<p>70% of pigs reared in the UK are farmed intensively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These  intelligent and inquisitive animals are forced to live entirely  indoors, in over-crowded sheds that do not allow them to express natural  behaviours such as foraging and nest-building.</li>\n<li> Intensively-reared  sows give birth and raise their young in farrowing crates. These metal  crates are so small that sows cannot turn around or suckle their  piglets.\u00a0 </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Birds factory farmed today grow three times as fast as they did 50 years ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broiler  chickens have been selectively bred and reared for their meat. The  majority live in large, crowded, windowless sheds with tens of thousands  of other birds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most sheep are not farmed intensively, but they still suffer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diseases such as lameness, mastitis, Sheep Scab, pneumonia and hypothermia are common.</li>\n<li>Sheep may be transported considerable distances to slaughter; some journeys last 24 hours or more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over 2.6 million cattle were slaughtered in the UK in 2009.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calves have to endure castration, disbudding and dehorning.</li>\n<li>Increasing numbers of beef cattle are housed in pens on concrete or slats without bedding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fish do feel pain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Almost half of the fish we consume today are reared intensively on fish farms, where they suffer increased stress and disease.</li>\n<li>When  wild fish are caught and hauled to the surface, decompression can cause  their eyes to pop out and their stomachs to be pushed out through their  mouths.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Can slaughter ever be humane?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most  land animals killed for food in the UK are stunned before bleeding to  death. We have some of the most stringent regulations in the world, but  still many animals die in fear and pain. For many vegetarians, no form  of slaughter can ever be considered humane.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Going vegetarian is one of the easiest ways to reduce your environmental impact.

    "letter_body": "compassion for animals is one of the main reasons why people become vegetarian. \n\nIn the UK alone, over two million land animals and almost 600,000 tonnes of fish are slaughtered each year, just so that people can eat their flesh or wear their skin.\n70% of pigs reared in the UK are farmed intensively.\n\n    * These intelligent and inquisitive animals are forced to live entirely indoors, in over-crowded sheds that do not allow them to express natural behaviours such as foraging and nest-building.\n    *\n      Intensively-reared sows give birth and raise their young in farrowing crates. These metal crates are so small that sows cannot turn around or suckle their piglets. \n\nBirds factory farmed today grow three times as fast as they did 50 years ago.\n\n    * Broiler chickens have been selectively bred and reared for their meat. The majority live in large, crowded, windowless sheds with tens of thousands of other birds.\n\nMost sheep are not farmed intensively, but they still suffer.\n\n    * Diseases such as lameness, mastitis, Sheep Scab, pneumonia and hypothermia are common.\n    * Sheep may be transported considerable distances to slaughter; some journeys last 24 hours or more.\n\nOver 2.6 million cattle were slaughtered in the UK in 2009.\n\n    * Calves have to endure castration, disbudding and dehorning.\n    * Increasing numbers of beef cattle are housed in pens on concrete or slats without bedding.\n\nFish do feel pain.\n\n    * Almost half of the fish we consume today are reared intensively on fish farms, where they suffer increased stress and disease.\n    * When wild fish are caught and hauled to the surface, decompression can cause their eyes to pop out and their stomachs to be pushed out through their mouths.\n\nCan slaughter ever be humane?\n\n    * Most land animals killed for food in the UK are stunned before bleeding to death. We have some of the most stringent regulations in the world, but still many animals die in fear and pain. For many vegetarians, no form of slaughter can ever be considered humane.\n\n\n\nAround 10 million turkeys are slaughtered in the UK to meet the demand for turkey at the Christmas table.\n\nIn the natural world a turkey\u2019s lifespan is around ten years but for food they are normally killed between 9 and 21 weeks. Regardless of how animals are kept or reared, and whether they have higher welfare standards, the true cost to farm animals at Christmas is their lives.\nTradition\n\nAccording to those organisations promoting turkey meat, Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without a traditional roast turkey! But how 'traditional' is it really?\n\nIt's thought that Edward VII (1901 - 1910) made eating turkey fashionable at Christmas and it's consumption remained a luxury until the 1950's when refrigerators became commonplace.\n\nThank you for taking the Time to read this Letter.\n\nSincerly, \nthe Petition Signers",

Take a brief look at your latest revenues, and you will see that Sundays alone could generate $500 million for great charities across the country. \n\nYou have said that you stick to your priorities, and that is commendable, but should you not reconsider your priorities? $500 million, per year, would do tremendous good for the needy and would indeed be the truly Christian thing to do. \n\nWhile you are a large corporation that requires intense vertical integration to maximize profits, think about the PR possibilities, at least. Ask yourselves, really, would Jesus, knowing the good He could do, really rest on Sunday? \n\nHere is your test: Follow the Bible to the letter and continue a no-Sunday policy, or make it a banner PR year and help millions of people by opening on Sunday and donating all profits to charity. \n\nThink about it.",

You have driven our children to taking pharma and harder drugs because they fear the reprocussions of a Cannabis arrest. You put K-2, synthetic marijuana on the shelves of NC for them to smoke!!!

Our proffessional adults who use recreationally for whatever pleasure should be left alone to do in the privacy of their lives what they please, they are hurting no one, and do not deserve to sacrifice a lifetime career behind a little Cannabis. Our Farmers should be growing our Hemp for products instead of importing it from other countries.. that is just plain common sense with no argument.. Why are our farmers not growing Hemp??

On October 12th, he tweeted, \u201cJust a reminder that my fear march is sponsored by Reese's\u2014the candy with something to hide. Specifically peanut butter.\u201d\n\nHe was right.  Reese\u2019s does have something to hide, but it\u2019s something much more terrifying than peanut butter.  The cocoa that is used to make Hershey\u2019s chocolate products, such as Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, is likely to have been harvested with the use of forced labor, trafficked labor, and the worst forms of child labor. \n\nReports of abusive child labor, trafficking, and forced labor in the production of cocoa have been circulating since 2001.  And while chocolate companies including Hershey promised to eliminate these egregious abuses in their cocoa supply chains at the time, the problems continue today almost a decade later.  \n\nWhile some major chocolate companies have taken additional steps to trace their global cocoa sources and institute additional labor and environmental standards for their suppliers, Hershey has taken no such steps and has been an industry laggard in agreeing to any forms of transparency.  \n\nI appreciate how he had used humor in the past to highlight child labor globally, the injustices faced by agricultural workers in the U.S. and many other import issues. Also, I'm happy that his Americone Dream ice cream is produced by Ben &amp; Jerry's, a company that has committed to sourcing all of its ingredients as Fair Trade Certified that can be by 2013. Will you now shed light on Hershey's frightening cocoa sourcing?\n\nBy revealing what it is that Reese\u2019s is truly hiding, child labor, you can help us, including Stephen Colbert himself, put the pressure on Hershey, and get the company to Raise the Bar when it comes to its cocoa souring policies.\n\n\nSincerely,",

Energy Solutions would then incinerate the dry material in its Bear Creek processor and return the remaining ash to Germany.\n \nAs Congressman Bart Gordon has said,  \"If a country like Germany has the capacity to produce large quantities of nuclear waste, it should also have the capacity to treat it and store it\u2026.I am  concerned once that waste is imported, nothing but an individual corporation's word prevents it from being shipped to U.S. disposal sites.\"\n \nWe already have too much nuclear waste of our own to dispose of and don't need more, thank you. This is the foot-in-the-door to bringing all the world\u2019s nuclear waste to the United States so that businesses such as Energy Solutions can turn a profit.

    "overview": "<p>Dogs do speak, it is like any other domestic animals, by association with us; and since their vocal cords won't enunciate like ours, however they manage tones clearly and expressively enough. Then they have resorted to facial, sound, and sign language. Would you believe telepathically? Wild animals are mostly telepaths, yet the same communicational links are present and used. Only if you never have felt either, go ahead and deny it. I don't believe its compassion that compels an activist, at least not me, I have my NoB.S. to thank- and I do-with every passing and coming sunrise and sunset. \u00a0Whenever I run with him, he loves street corners, as they are \"pee blogs\" he says, and what dog answers are found in pee mail! \u00a0He says, \u00a0\"They are none of my business\" \u00a0and I couldn't agree with him more \u00a0(he has promised that when I'm ready, he will reveal all). The last great informational tidbit of wisdom he told me was, \"That physical force is never necessary, Love, and patience will suffice, always\". Pawing the ground as if to emphasize he quips \"You understand, we only exist on His time\" (God, The Force, Whatever) it doesn't matter, for it's all good. The simple basics, (food,water,shelter, a blankie or bed) and the indeed, the rest is bull fertilizer!\" K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid). \u00a0That's when the tears well up and pour out, that's when I know I have chosen correctly. Everyone must reach out, and explain it to anyone who doesn't know that animals do speak. Walt Disney said it all in his films, as many other cinematographers have as well. He dumb it down a notch so everyone would understand, and they continue to forget this ever so quickly, dismissing it as childish behavior. Animals have been trying to tell us to stop, just stop and look around and \"smell for yourself\" NoB.S. insists. As if \u00a0smells could enter most peoples cognitive brain through the schnoz. \"You understand that almost everything is nothing more than a simple misunderstanding between parties\" NoB.S. insists. \"That is the origin of 'BS' it was a clever invention by the mean people of the world. The very same ones that peddle fear and killjoys. \u00a0Accept no substitutes for the truth, at the risk of your own mind\" NoB.S. blindsides me. \"It's not imaginary if you just believe, things transcend\" now he is slightly agitated in saying. \"Everything can change forms, but it can't be created or destroyed\" I hear. Great to know, Science has it's 2 absolutes and they have persisted for a very long time, must be true then. Or must we prove it just once more, and be extra sure. Lets go to a million, then a billion, and a trillion, maybe we can entertain everyone forever and make some $ along the way. Why not? And do it benevolently. NoB.S. is real and his formal name is Felix Von Blu, and is a blue Weimaraner from P.M. Weimaraner's in or near Great Falls, Montana. Dawna Miller, the breeder will tell you of her passion for the breed. They come with long hair as well, and no docking of the tails with long hair, sure is cool beans to me. That will be my next, a long haired femfatale so maybe he trims those long hangs at corners reading bitches pee mail he will never meet. \"How do you like them star apples, leeches, and gardenias\" he asks making small talk? \"Just fine\" I say, \"but you think this is Eden, so then why does everyone want to kill the animals?\" To this he becomes real quite, and hasn't answered just yet, just a single tear runs down from the most beautiful set of eyes that have shown me his very soul.</p>",

    "letter_body": "On December 15, 2010, the California-based Armenian Youth Federation (AYF) launched a public defamation campaign against the Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant for his contract to promote the Turkish Airlines. The deal is part of the flagship carrier's plan to introduce a lucrative Istanbul-Los Angeles direct flights by March 2011. Turkish Airlines, a Star Alliance member and publicly-held company with a considerable U.S. investment, currently carries millions of passengers worldwide, including on the flight routes from Istanbul to Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago.\n\nThe Armenian pressure group is demanding Bryant to reject the deal or to accept its one-sided interpretation of the historic World War I ethnic strife in Ottoman Empire as the \"Armenian genocide\". In coordination, the Armenian-American special interest groups are pushing to pass the House Resolution 252 to legislate history at the \"lame-duck\" session of the Congress this week. \n\nThe limited ethnic agenda of these Armenian-American groups is sought to spoil U.S. relations with Turkey, a crucial NATO ally, to damage Turkish business interests, and to derail the Turkish-Armenian rapprochement initiated in 2008. The reconciliation, conducted in parallel with negotiations to resolve the long-standing Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, may open way to lasting security and peace in the South Caucasus, a vital region for U.S. interests.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the actions of Armenian-American groups come amidst an investigation over a $163 million Medicare scam, the largest fraud in the history of U.S. health care system, by an Armenian-American crime ring with connections to Armenian government officials. In addition, the U.S. diplomatic cables published last week by the whistle-blowing site Wikileaks uncovered the fact of Armenia's shipment of weapons to Iran in 2008. According to the information from the U.S. embassy in Armenia, the shipment to Iran, made not without the knowledge of Armenian President Sargsyan, ended up in the hands of Shiite militia in Iraq. At least one U.S. serviceman was identified to have been killed by an Armenian-shipped RPG in Iraq in the spring of 2008. \n\nI join all Turkic-Americans to express my strong disapproval of the actions of Armenian-American groups. I strongly believe that instead of racist attacks against the favorite basketball star or attempts to legislate controversial history in the U.S. Congress, Armenian-American groups could better expend their efforts to address serious issues arising in their community. Moreover, their dedication to Armenian cause could prove more useful in securing the welfare of Armenian people and the development of their country in a sustainable peace with all of its neighbors and away from undesirable associations.",

In 1997, her children were starving, so she fled to China with her husband, who was a former soldier, and five of her children. Two of her children were caught crossing the border, but the rest of the family lived in China for three years. Two of the children who made it with her to China were later caught and repatriated to Nor\u00a0th Korea, and her husband eventually died of natural causes. Afterward, she lived with her granddaughter in Yangji until they were apprehended by Chinese police while visiting Dandong.<br><br>Former Detainee #24 was eventually forcibly repatriated in a group of fifty North Korean\u00a0s, some of whom were pregnant women, bound together by their wrists. They were taken, initially, for eighteen days to the Namindong bo-wi-bu (National Security Agency) police ku-ryu-jang in Sinuiju, who initially accused Former Detainee #24 of being corrupted by capitalism in China. She convinced them that she had gone to China only for food, so she was sent for one month to the do-jip-kyul-so in South Sinuiju run by the In-min-bo-an-seong (People\u2019s Safety Agency) police. Though she had heard that Kim Jong Il had recently said North Korean repatriates should not be treated harshly, there were beatings.<br><br>Detainees were fed the usual steamed corn, and as it was midsummer, most prisoners were sent out to work in the rice fields. This grandmother was too old and weak for such labor, and as she herself had had seven children, she was taken in the mornings to a nearby medical building to help care for the pregnant detainees. She helped deliver seven babies, some of which were full-term, some of which were injection-induced abortions. All of the babies were killed.<br><br>The first baby was born to a twenty-eight-year-old woman named Lim, who had been happily married to a Chinese man. The baby boy was born healthy and unusually large, owing to the mother\u2019s ability to eat well during pregnancy in China. Former Detainee #24 assisted in holding the baby\u2019s head during delivery and then cut the umbilical cord. But when she started to hold the baby and wrap him in a blanket, a guard grabbed the newborn by one leg and threw it in a large, plastic-lined box. A doctor explained that since North Korea was short on food, the country should not have to feed the children of foreign fathers. When the box was full of babies, Former Detainee #24 later learned, it was taken outside and buried.<br><br>She next helped deliver a baby to a woman named Kim, who also gave birth to a healthy full-term boy. As Former Detainee #24 caressed the baby, it tried to suckle her finger. The guard again came over and yelled at her to put the baby in the box. As she stood up, the guard slapped her, chipping her tooth. The third baby she delivered was premature \u2014 the size of an ear of corn \u2014 and the fourth baby was even smaller. She gently laid those babies in the box. The next day she delivered three more very premature babies and also put them in the box. The babies in the box gave her nightmares. Two days later, the premature babies had died but the two full-term baby boys were still alive. Even though their skin had turned yellow and their mouths blue, they still blinked their eyes. The agent came by, and seeing that two of the babies in the box were not dead yet, stabbed them with forceps at a soft spot in their skulls. Former Detainee #24 says she then lost her self-control and started screaming at the agent, who kicked her so hard in the leg that she fainted. Deemed unsuitable for further hospital work, she was returned to the detention center until her release several weeks later.<br><br>Upon release, Former Detainee #24 returned to China but was again caught and this time repatriated to Hoeryong. Separated from her granddaughter, she became hysterical and started singing Christian hymns that she had learned in China, and ranting against Kim Jong Il for making Koreans leave their native villages while God took care of Korean people in China. Fortunately, her guards regarded her as a crazy old woman, not an enemy of the regime. Indeed, they took pity on her, even reuniting her with her granddaughter and helping the two of them to again cross the Tumen River into China. This time, she met some South Korean Christian relief workers who helped enable her and her granddaughter to make the trek through China to Southeast Asia. She arrived in South Korea in March 2001.<br><br>The interviewer had difficulty finding words to describe the sadness in this grandmothers\u2019 eyes and the anguish on her face as she recounted her experience as a midwife at the detention center in South Sinuiju.\"</p>\n<p>Both guards and torturers are trained not to see the prisoners as human beings, but as sub-human and animals. One witness described how she saw a prisoner giving birth to a baby and the nurses cutting the umbilical cord and then smothering the baby with a wet towel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another witness told CSW how children were also interned in these camps, but were not allowed any contact with their mothers, who although they could see them, could not meet their needs of hunger and warmth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sanitary conditions in these prisons are appalling, with no provision for washing or cleaning the one set of clothes prisoners are allowed.</p>",

This is the worst of the worst; North Korea is the grand master of imprisonment and oppression.

Guards are brainwashed to thinking inmates are sub-human and allowed to do anything they please to prisoners, except quickly killing inmates. One man said life at camp 22 is the slowest death you can imagine. Inhumane experiments are conducted on all people including newborn infants. Women are not allowed to scream while giving birth to babies if they do guards will beat the pregnant women until she stops screaming. When the baby is born if it starts crying the guards usually smother it to death or leave the baby face down on the ground to die. If the baby happens to survive it must endure the harsh conditions the mother must endure. One lucky prisoner escaped and lived to tell his story in South Korea. He said, Prisoners in the worst condition where hardly recognizable as human, they looked like beasts he said. 1000 \u2013 2000 Prisoners die every year and a large percentage are kids and infants. Unfortunately they die from hunger, beatings, and executions. This is far from humane it is more like a hidden holocaust that no one can do anything about. Animals receive much better treatment then this; they are being treated equivalent to an insect.",

In the almost 11 months that Mr. Waggoner and MMRC have been operational in Haiti, both have garnered well-deserved reputations for sacrifice, integrity, and professionalism. \nIn addition, Mr. Waggoner and MMRC have worked closely with respected international agencies in Haiti such as PAHO (Pan American Health Organization), Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Jenkins-Penn Haitian Relief Organization (JP/HRO), Praecipio International, Open Hands and others to bring relief and assistance to the Haitian people.  In the recent cholera outbreak especially, Mr. Waggoner and MMRC have often been called on by these international partners to bring first-response, life-saving emergency interventions of medical supplies and personnel.  These reputable organizations can attest to Mr. Waggoner\u2019s character and professionalism. \n\nI request that you do everything in your power to secure the unconditional and immediate release of Mr. Waggoner.  Each additional day that he is wrongfully detained in the National Penitentiary not only puts him at greater unnecessary personal risk, but also will have a deleterious effect on the number of foreign medical and relief volunteers who would be willing to serve in Haiti under such unstable and threatening circumstances.

In fact, the National Taxpayers Union recently urged all Members to vote Yes on S. 372, stating \"Roll call votes on S. 372 will be significantly weighted in our annual Rating of Congress.\"  Federal whistleblower reform has been endorsed by more than 400 groups, comprised of approximately 80 million voters. \n\nWe urge you to heed the taxpayers' calls and support passage of S. 372 this week. \n\nSincerely,",

If New Mexico had at that time required a DNA sample to be taken upon arrest, Katie\u00b4s killer would have been caught three months after the murder when the murderer was arrested for another predatory crime. Instead, the killer was released back onto the streets; it was three long years before he was finally apprehended again and linked to Katie\u00b4s murder.</p>\n<p><strong>About Katie's Law</strong></p>\n<p>The Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act (H. R. 988/S.517) sponsored by U.S. Representative Adam Schiff\u00a0(D-CA 29) and U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), is a bill that will provide incentive by providing additional federal funding to states\u00a0for collecting a DNA sample on arrest, at the same time fingerprints and mug shots are taken.\u00a0 DNA testing only requires a simple cheek swab upon arrest.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collecting DNA upon felony arrest means allowing law enforcement to take a DNA swab from the arrestee, at the same time,\u00a0the arrestee is fingerprinted.\u00a0DNA testing only requires a simple cheek swab upon arrest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then once the DNA sample is collected, the DNA is sent to a lab, where the crime scene sample and DNA\u00a0rape kits is tested against the offender.</p>\n<p>At the same, the DNA taken from the offender, it\u00a0would go\u00a0into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which is a computer program, where DNA samples taken from crime scenes and sexual assault victims are stored.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the DNA analysts use CODIS to search for DNA profiles from other crime scenes and DNA Rape kits and their convicted offenders and arrestees. Then CODIS generates leads for investigators when the match is obtained.</p>\n<p>Katie's Law, however, would provide an\u00a0additional 10-15%\u00a0\u00a0extra funding from the Edward Byrne Gran for states that collect DNA on arrest\u00a0at the same time the arrestee\u00a0is fingerprints - for certain felony crimes.\u00a0\u00a0 By passing arrestee DNA legislation, law enforcement officials can catch repeat offenders sooner, prevent violent crimes, exonerate the innocent, protect civil liberties, reduce criminal justice costs, save more lives and use DNA to its full potential.</p>\n<p><strong>The Reason We Need To Collect DNA For Felony Arrests</strong></p>\n<p>States have been collecting DNA from convicted felons for almost two decades, and it's helped solve thousands of crimes. \u00a0But, more needs to be done.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By collecting DNA from arrestees at the same time the arrestee is fingerprinted, it would allow law enforcement to gain information to see if the suspect has been being involved in other crimes.\u00a0 By doing that, it will prevent other rapes and murders, and it also will exonerate the wrongfully accused.\u00a0\u00a0 When DNA is collected from all felony arrestees, law enforcements can catch criminals make faster, and in the end saves more lives.</p>\n<p>Studies have shown that in burglaries and other non-violent crimes there is a 40% chance that these crimes are being committed by someone who has already committed violent crimes, perhaps even murder.\u00a0 If they haven't, there is an 80% chance that they eventually will commit a violent crime. That means 40% of these non-violent crime scenes could have evidence that would lead to a match with evidence from a serious assault, rape or murder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There have been lots of cases where if DNA had been collected upon arrest, it would have saved a large number of women from being rape and even murdered, and also saved people from being wrongfully incarcerated for crimes they did not commit.</p>\n<p>A Chicago Study taken in 2005, showed that 60 violent crimes could have been prevented if only DNA had been collected for a prior felony arrest. \u00a0In each case, the offender had previously committed an undetected violent crimes that investigators could have identified immediately through a DNA match. \u00a0Unfortunately, DNA was not required at arrest. The eight offenders in Chicago accumulated a total of 21 felony arrests before law enforcement officials were finally able to convict them of violent crimes.</p>\n<p>Plus collecting DNA from felony arrests is cost effective, in the sense that it saves time and money in investigations.\u00a0 Collecting DNA upon felony arrest does not violate any constitutional rights.\u00a0 The courts have ruled that collecting DNA upon arrest is not unconstitutional.\u00a0 The DNA that is taken is kept in police laboratories and is confidential, and has strict penalties for people who misuse it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Katie's Law would;</strong></p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; Incentivize states to meet minimum standards for arrestee DNA collection. The minimum standard asks states to collect DNA samples from those arrested for, indicted for, or charged with certain violent felonies and compare these samples with pre-existing records in the national DNA database. States that comply will receive a 5 percent increase in their Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program; <br><br>&gt;&gt; Incentivize states to meet enhanced arrestee DNA standards by providing states a 10 percent increase in their Byrne JAG funding if they collect DNA from those arrested for certain crimes and submit the samples for inclusion in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS); <br><br>&gt;&gt; Apply current federal law to ensure that any DNA profile of an arrestee that is not convicted is expunged;<br><br>&gt;&gt; Reduce the wasteful spending associated with the costly investigation of false leads. A study in Indiana estimated that taxpayers spend more than $2,000 per crime for officer response, investigation, prosecution, and adjudication. Catching repeat offenders early will reduce costs over time;<br><br>&gt;&gt; Protect the privacy of arrestees. Information obtained from a DNA sample and submitted to national DNA databases only contains 13 to 15 numeric indicators.

    "letter_body": "I urge you to support and pass the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2011 (H. R. 988/S.517).\n\nThe Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act (H. R. 988/S.517) sponsored by U.S. Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA 29) and U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), is a bill that will require states to collect a DNA sample upon arrest at the same time as fingerprints -- for certain felony crimes, to maximize the potential of forensic DNA to solve and prevent violent crimes.\n\nKatie Sepich, was 22 years old when she was brutally raped and murdered in Las Cruces, New Mexico. If New Mexico had at that time required a DNA sample to be taken upon arrest, Katie\u00b4s killer would have been caught three months after the murder when the murderer was arrested for another predatory crime. Instead, the killer was released back onto the streets; it was three long years before he was finally apprehended again and linked to Katie\u00b4s murder.\n\nKatie's Law, however, would provide an additional 10-15%  extra funding from the Edward Byrne Gran for states that collect DNA on arrest at the same time the arrestee is fingerprints - for certain felony crimes.   By passing arrestee DNA legislation, law enforcement officials can catch repeat offenders sooner, prevent violent crimes, exonerate the innocent, protect civil liberties, reduce criminal justice costs, save more lives and use DNA to its full potential.\n\nStudies have shown that in burglaries and other non-violent crimes there is a 40% chance that these crimes are being committed by someone who has already committed violent crimes, perhaps even murder.  If they haven't, there is an 80% chance that they eventually will commit a violent crime. That means 40% of these non-violent crime scenes could have evidence that would lead to a match with evidence from a serious assault, rape or murder.  \n\nHowever, by collecting DNA from arrestees at the same time the arrestee is fingerprinted, it would allow law enforcement to gain information to see if the suspect has been being involved in other crimes, it will prevent other rapes and murders from being prevented, and it will exonerate the innocent.\n\nPlus collecting DNA from felony arrests is cost effective, in the sense that it saves time and money in investigations.  Collecting DNA upon felony arrest does not violate any constitutional rights.  The courts have ruled that collecting DNA upon arrest is not unconstitutional.  The DNA that is taken is kept in police laboratories and is confidential, and has strict penalties for people who misuse it.  \n\nVictims need to be entitled to equal due process rights, along with their defendants, and I hope you realize that this law will save lives in more ways than one.\n\nTherefore, I ask that the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate please vote yes when this bill comes before committee and the floor, and to co-sponsor this legislation.  Finally, I ask that President Obama sign it into law.\n\nSincerely,",

Shockingly. initial outrage over the video centered not on the fact that the unidentified woman was being beaten by police officers but rather that she was being flogged \"improperly\" under Sharia or Muslim law. The Sudanese public order system allows for flogging on a person's back, but not to the face, hands or legs. \n\nWomen's rights activists immediately protested peacefully noting that this woman, who was arrested under Sudanese  \"public order laws\" which are vaguely worded and applied unjustly, was being publicly beaten in any way, shape or form.\n\nAdvocates from Human Rights Watch to Amnesty International say that the flogging laws also violate Africa's Charter of Human and People's Rights which prohibits \"cruel and inhuman punishment\" and are calling on the Sudanese government to repeal the morality laws.\n\nIt's impossible for women to participate with full equality and dignity in Sudanese society if they are under constant fear that their personal expression may be cause for punishment as severe and humiliating as public flogging.\n\nPlease do all you can to help stop the human rights abuses against women and immediately divest your holdings in PetroChina on behalf of the women who was publicly flogged - and all women in Sudan who are being unjustly and violently discriminated against by the Sudanese authorities.",

They are dying of the effects of genocide three decades after the collapse of the Khmer Rouge Regime that took the lives of over 2 million people.  Since arriving in the United States, surivors have made new homes and raised children. They work hard, often at low paying jobs and support  families back in Cambodia. Many members of the community are today living the American dream, but many, many more are still struggling to survive. We know that 30% of our survivors are disabled and living below the poverty level. We also know that survivors are dying of diabetes six times more often than the general population and of stroke twice as often as others.\n\nScience tells us bodies and minds that experienced traumatic stress are vulnerable to disease. Emerging research strongly suggests that this vulnerability is passed onto the children of survivors. In 2005, the leadership of the National Cambodian American Health Initiative (NCAHI) declared a \u201chealth emergency\u201d due to the escalating rates of chronic disease, the high rate of mortality and the lack of human resources to assure that Cambodians have access to proper care.  As you may know, 95% of Cambodia\u2019s educated population was exterminated during the Khmer Rouge period leaving few Khmer speaking health care providers to care for the community.\n\nWe are writing to you to ask that you support a Congressional hearing on the health of Cambodian survivors of war, torture and genocide who are living in the United States. We ask that this hearing be held during the week of April 17th which is the anniversary of the fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge. Community leaders, survivors and experts in Cambodian health are willing to come to Washington to tell our stories and to launch a strategic plan for health that will not only save lives, but save important health care dollars.",

But there is little support for logging the few remaining big trees in the watershed and building more logging roads.\n\nPlease consider implementing Alternative 2 of the Rustler project. Please consider implementing that alternative such that \u201cdensity management\u201d and \u201csanitation\u201d logging units do not remove large diameter legacy trees and snags. \n\nIn my opinion, the Central Big Butte Springs Watershed has already done more than its share to provide for our wood fiber needs.

Advocates in South Africa just formed a national coalition to stop Walmart's expansion to their country.  In Bangladesh, Walmart lobbied against a wage increase for some of the lowest paid garment workers in the world and the company has not effectively engaged suppliers to ensure safe working conditions which most recently led to the death of scores of workers when a fire broke out in their factory.\n\nIt is clear that Walmart needs to gain access to DC, their domestic sales have been down for years. City Councilmembers have a responsibility to make sure that any new jobs that come to the District meet the standards that we have in our community and workers demand around the world: jobs that offer respect and dignity to workers, make sure they have a voice in their workplace, and offer a career for long-term employees.",
