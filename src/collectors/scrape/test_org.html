In a globalized economy, corporations from developed countries produce consumer goods ranging from coffee to cellphones in poor developing countries, where they can take advantage of cheap labor and lack of environmental or community protections. Workers, including child workers, must toil extremely long hours for wages that are barely subsistence wages, and often under unsanitary and unsafe conditions. In many countries there is little or no labor law enforcement, and many workers are prevented from joining organizations to advance their interests.  <br /><br />Alarmingly, an estimated 211 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 are compelled to work around the world. These children produce rubber, cotton, coffee and work in mines to produce goods that are traded to the United States and other developed countries. Unable to go to school, these children face little hope of escaping poverty in their future.  <br /><br />Advocacy for these workers is essential to ensuring their protection, strengthening their voice, and ending abuses that violate their rights and dignity. ILRF is an advocacy organization dedicated to achieving just and humane treatment for workers worldwide. ILRF serves a unique role among human rights organizations as advocates for and with working poor around the world. We believe that all workers have the right to a safe working environment where they are treated with dignity and respect, and where they can organize freely to defend and promote their rights and interests. We are committed to ending the problems of child labor, forced labor, and other abusive practices. We promote enforcement of labor rights internationally through public education and mobilization, research, litigation, legislation, and collaboration with labor, government and business groups.</p><ul class="list-inline list-inline-space-m type-weak"><li class="mrs"><a href="http://www.laborrights.org" target="_blank" class="link-subtle">http://www.laborrights.org</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row mbxxl"><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><h3>Started 5 petitions</h3><a href="/p/jc-penney-dont-break-your-promise-to-families-of-workers-who-died-making-your-clothes" class="link-block box box-basic pan mbxl bg-brighter"><div class="pam"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9"><div class="type-ellipsis type-weak mbxxxs"><div class="badge badge-victory mbm js-victory">Victory</div><div class="type-s">Petitioning Janet Dhillon</div></div><h4 class="mtn"><div style="max-height: 105px" class="hide-overflow" data-view="components/ellipsis" data-height="105" data-_block="J.C.

Thanks to pressure from Change.org members, seven of the eight brands (including J.C.

Now J.C. Penney has shamefully broken this pledge. Today, six of the eight brands continue negotiating in good faith to establish an adequate worker compensation fund and sustainable fire safety initiatives.  J.C. Penney, however, has dropped out.
We need your help to send a message to J.C. Penney to honor the commitments they made in January.
In Bangladesh, nearly 500 workers have died in factory fires during the past five years.  Establishing effective initiatives to prevent fires like this from occurring again is critical.

The Children’s Place has a policy against using child and forced labor, but it has not publicly addressed the unique state-sponsored practice of forced child labor in Uzbekistan nor has it provided any information about how it ensures that its suppliers do not use Uzbek cotton tainted by these egregious human rights abuses. So far, the Children’s Place has refused to support human rights and speak out against forced child labor in the cotton industry, unlike its top competitors like the Gap and Gymboree. 
Your actions make a difference! In the past, your e-mail actions targeting Abercrombie &amp;amp;amp; Fitch and Gymboree have led these companies to announce policies prohibiting the use of Uzbek cotton. Take action NOW to tell the Children’s Place to respect international labor rights in their cotton sourcing.

In a globalized economy, corporations from developed countries produce consumer goods ranging from coffee to cellphones in poor developing countries, where they can take advantage of cheap labor and lack of environmental or community protections. Workers, including child workers, must toil extremely long hours for wages that are barely subsistence wages, and often under unsanitary and unsafe conditions. In many countries there is little or no labor law enforcement, and many workers are prevented from joining organizations to advance their interests.  <br /><br />Alarmingly, an estimated 211 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 are compelled to work around the world. These children produce rubber, cotton, coffee and work in mines to produce goods that are traded to the United States and other developed countries. Unable to go to school, these children face little hope of escaping poverty in their future.  <br /><br />Advocacy for these workers is essential to ensuring their protection, strengthening their voice, and ending abuses that violate their rights and dignity. ILRF is an advocacy organization dedicated to achieving just and humane treatment for workers worldwide. ILRF serves a unique role among human rights organizations as advocates for and with working poor around the world. We believe that all workers have the right to a safe working environment where they are treated with dignity and respect, and where they can organize freely to defend and promote their rights and interests. We are committed to ending the problems of child labor, forced labor, and other abusive practices.

Penney has shamefully broken the public commitment it made in January to compensate the victims’ families and to finally take real steps to stop these fires.  As you know, other companies continue to negotiate in good faith with labor rights advocates to establish a fair compensation for workers and a meaningful fire safety program.  \n\nHow can you walk away from the commitment you made to your customers and the broader public? How can you walk away from the workers who produce your garments and the families of the workers who died in the fire?\n\nU.S. consumers want a substantive and meaningful response to incidents like this. More than 65,000 people from 71 countries called on you to act earlier in 2011 so that tragedies like this one never happen again. \n\nI support the large consortium of Bangladeshi and international groups calling on J.C. Penney to provide just compensation to the victims and their families and launch thorough, independent, well funded and publicly transparent safety inspections of all multi-story supplier factories in Bangladesh in the supply chain of each brand and retailer.

Liberia.</em></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The majority of workers who labor as \"rubber tappers\" must carry two heavy buckets of raw latex weighing 75 pounds each on both ends of a stick on their back for miles.  This back-breaking system of transportation has long been left behind by other rubber production companies globally and it's time for Firestone to stop this abuse.  It's unacceptable that a tire company has not provided some wheels to workers to help transport rubber. </p>\n<p>Firestone workers in Liberia have faced severe abuses for 84 years, but have recently made major advances in securing their rights.  After a major organizing campaign, workers finally held the first free and fair union elections on the plantation in 2007 and signed an historic collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in 2008.

According to activists involved in the campaign, the messages from Change.org definitely helped increase pressure on Firestone. The company's initial contract proposal included no wage increases and they resisted updating the transportation system for the buckets of latex. But they eventually agreed to both of these, which were the key demands of the Change.org petition.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, the Firestone Agricultural Workers Union of Liberia (FAWUL) signed a new contract with Firestone that includes an agreement to improve the methods for transporting latex on the plantation so that workers will no longer have to carry two buckets weighing 75 pounds each on a stick on their backs for miles.

In a globalized economy, corporations from developed countries produce consumer goods ranging from coffee to cellphones in poor developing countries, where they can take advantage of cheap labor and lack of environmental or community protections. Workers, including child workers, must toil extremely long hours for wages that are barely subsistence wages, and often under unsanitary and unsafe conditions. In many countries there is little or no labor law enforcement, and many workers are prevented from joining organizations to advance their interests.  <br /><br />Alarmingly, an estimated 211 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 are compelled to work around the world. These children produce rubber, cotton, coffee and work in mines to produce goods that are traded to the United States and other developed countries. Unable to go to school, these children face little hope of escaping poverty in their future.  <br /><br />Advocacy for these workers is essential to ensuring their protection, strengthening their voice, and ending abuses that violate their rights and dignity. ILRF is an advocacy organization dedicated to achieving just and humane treatment for workers worldwide. ILRF serves a unique role among human rights organizations as advocates for and with working poor around the world. We believe that all workers have the right to a safe working environment where they are treated with dignity and respect, and where they can organize freely to defend and promote their rights and interests.
