      "message": "Thank you all for taking the time to express your support for H.R.647, the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act. As Sara has shown us, we need to update the laws that are meant to assist Americans with disabilities. Like everyone else, they deserve the opportunity to save and plan for the future. This is why I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the ABLE Act and support its goals.\r\n\r\nThe government already recognizes the value in giving American families a helping hand in saving for the future. We provide special tax advantages that help people save for college, retirement, and other life events. Currently, people with disabilities who have unique challenges and different needs have no appropriate savings instrument to prepare for their future. The ABLE Act would fix that. Throughout my career in Congress, I have been a strong advocate for increased funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which helps ensure that all Americans have access to the educational resources the need to enrich their lives. I've also supported federal help to states and organizations implementing disability laws and regulations and have worked to ensure that the reauthorization of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) properly meets the needs of the community.\r\n\r\nI will continue to fight in Congress for the rights of Americans with disabilities and to ensure that our country is giving them the support that they need to live full and healthy lives. I hope that the ABLE Act is brought the House floor for a vote soon so that we can move this legislation to the desk of the President.",
