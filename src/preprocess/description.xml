    <strong>What the Fork Are You Doing With Your Produce, Walmart and Whole Foods?</strong>
</p>\n<p>In 2013, a staggering 17.5 million households faced hunger. Part of the problem is the prohibitively high price
of produce. Many low income American families simply can’t afford fresh fruits and vegetables. Yet,
<strong>we throw away nearly 26% of all produce before it even reaches the grocery store due mostly to cosmetic
    standards from large grocers that dictate exactly how fruits and veggies should look.
</strong>
If produce fails to make the grade for size, shape, or color, retailers deem it \"ugly\" and refuse to sell it in their
stores.
<strong>
    <em>Billions of pounds</em>
    of good, healthy produce goes uneaten because it’s not pretty!

. Together with Stefanie Sacks, we are asking you to call on Whole Foods and Walmart to help stop massive food waste by
agreeing to sell cosmetically “less than perfect” produce.

<strong>We want Walmart and Whole Foods to combat food waste by marketing ugly produce as they do traditional produce
    using a fun campaign like the French supermarket giant<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/98441820\"

</a>
did with its “Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables Campaign.” Stores in Europe,<a href=

</a>, and <a
href=\"http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/loblaw-plans-naturally-imperfect-discount-produce-1.2276996\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canada</a> have started selling not quite \"perfect\" produce, offering it at an average of 30% off, and it has increased store traffic and total sales. In the U.S. Raley's has also <a

We are asking two of America’s largest retailers to do something simple, effective and good for the retailers’ and
customers’ bottom line. This is truly low-hanging fruit in terms of its environmental and social benefits. One out of
six Americans is food insecure, and more than four out of five is produce-deficient.
<strong>With statistics like this, it is simply irresponsible to encourage waste of good, healthy and perfectly edible
    food.
</strong>
</p>\n<p>
<strong>Join the “UGLY fruit and veg revolution” and let’s ask Walmart and Whole Foods to be part of the solution, not
    the problem. Tell them to add the “uglies” to their store aisles so you can save money, fight hunger and help the
    environment all in one. The solution might look ugly, but the result will be something BEAUTIFUL.
